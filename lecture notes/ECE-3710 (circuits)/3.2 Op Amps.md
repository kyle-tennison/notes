# 3.2 Op Amps

## 3.2.1 Introduction to Op Amps and Ideal Behavior

An **Operational Amplifier** (Op Amp) is made of transistors, resistors, etc. It is an IC. They allow you to boost power and voltage.

The $V_S$ terminals power the IC; the remaining pins are inputs and outputs. Usually, these power supply pins are neglected in circuit diagrams.

Op Amps are often used in **active filters**; an *active* element is one that depends on a power supply.

The output voltage is given by:

$$v_o = A(v_+ - v_-)$$

However, there is a maximum $v_o$ called the **saturation** voltage, which will (often) be the voltage of the supply. The value $A$ is the *open loop gain*, which changes based on the device.

If $A$ is very large, $v_o$ will reach saturation very quickly. In this case, we can simplify an Op Amp's output voltage to be:

$$v_o=\begin{cases}V_s &\text{if } v_{in}>0\\ -V_s &\text{if } v_{in}<0 \end{cases}$$

where $v_{in} = v_+ - v_-$. 

In this case, the output of any input will be pushed to either saturation value depending on the sign:

In an **ideal op amp**, it is assumed that:
- There is no current flowing between $v_+$ and $v_-$
- $v_+-v_- = 0$ 

## 3.2.2 Buffer Circuits

A buffer circuit is used to boost power without changing the voltage waveform: $v_{in}=v_{out}$. The idea is that while the voltage is the same, the power is not.

If a buffer circuit *is not* used, the input voltage may not be able to provide the necessary current, and the voltage will drop. A buffer circuit is easy to drop into an existing circuit.

## 3.2.3 Basic Op Amp Configurations

### Non-Inverting Amplifiers

![|430](Pasted%20image%2020250419171543.png)

As shown above, this Non-Inverting Amplifier. The equation for output voltage is:

$$V_o = \frac{R_2+R_3}{R_3}V_{in}$$
Alternatively, we can express it in terms of **Gain**, with:

$$V_o=GV_{in}\text{\;\;\;where\;\;\;}G=\frac{R_2+R_3}{R_3}$$

### Inverting Amplifier

![](Pasted%20image%2020250419172332.png)

The circuit shown above is an inverting amplifier. The equation for output voltage is:

$$V_o = -\frac{R_f}{R_1}V_{in}$$

Or, we can say the gain is $G=\frac{-R_f}{R_1}$ where again $V_o=GV_{in}$ . 

### Difference Circuit

![](Pasted%20image%2020250419173607.png)

A difference circuit has an output of:

$$V_o=\frac{R_f}{R_1}(V_2-V_1)$$

In this case, the gain is defined as $G=R_f/R_1$. 

### Summing Amplifier

![](Pasted%20image%2020250419173807.png)

This is similar to a difference circuit, except the inputs are summed.

$$V_o=G_1V_1+G_2V_2$$

where

$$G_1 = - \frac{R_f}{R_1}, G_2 = - \frac{R_f}{R_2}$$

## 3.2.4 Differentiators and Integrators

### Differentiator Circuit

![|478](Pasted%20image%2020250419174456.png)


The output voltage of is:

$$V_o = -RC \frac{dV_{in}}{dt}$$

### Integrator Circuit

![|459](Pasted%20image%2020250419174748.png)

An integrator circuit builds off the fact that $V_c = \frac{1}{C} \int _0^t i\;dt$.

The output voltage is given by:

$$V_o = \frac{-1}{RC}\int \limits _0^t V_{in} \; dt$$

It is assumed that the switch is opened at $t=0$. 


## 3.2.5 Active Filters

The issue with analog filters is that they deplete power and aren't isolated. If you add a load to the output, the filter's properties change immediately. Active filters fix this issue. They are often make of op-amps.
