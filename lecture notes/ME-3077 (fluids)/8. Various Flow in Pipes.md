# 8. Various Flow in Pipes

## 8.1 General Characteristics


### Turbulence 

The [Reynold's Number](7.%20Buckingham%20Pi%20Theorem.md#^reyonolds-number) primarily dictates whether the flow within a pipe is turbulent. 

For a general, round pipe:
- $\text{Re} < 2100$ is generally laminar
- $\text{Re} > 4000$ is generally turbulent
- Numbers in between are transitional
- Factors such as surface friction, pipe geometry, etc. can change this.

### Entrance Region

When a fluid enters a pipe, it is generally uniform, but due to viscous effects, the fluid sticks to the pipe boundary. This is called the *no-slip boundary condition*. Shown in this figure, from $(1) \to (2)$ the flow transitions from uniform to "fully developed." 

The *entrance length* $l_e$ is given by:

$$\frac{l_e}{D}= 0.06 \text{Re,} \quad \text{for laminar flow, or,}$$

$$\frac{l_e}{D}=4.4(\text{Re})^{1/6},\quad \text{for turbulent flow.}$$

The flow is governed by a **pressure gradient** $\Delta p = p_2 - p_1$, which is canceled out by the *shear stresses* that occur on the pipe's surface. If the flow were perfectly inviscid, the pressure gradient would be zero (assuming everything is horizontal).  In both cases, the fluid flows through the pipe with no acceleration.

The pressure gradient drops relatively steeply in the entrance region, then stabilizes to be constant. You can find this fully developed slope very easily:

$$\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \frac{- \Delta p}{l} $$
