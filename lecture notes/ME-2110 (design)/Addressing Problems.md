# Addressing Problems

1/8/25

---

Some tools to understand the problem:
1. Thoroughly read the problem statement.
2. Examine previous solutions; talk to and research the people who made them.

Types of design:
1. Original: New products and ideas.
2. Adaptive: Adapt a previous design for some other task.
3. Variant: Vary/rearrange an existing design for the same task.
4. Redesign: Adapt & Variant.

The difference between amateur and experienced engineers is the speed of rejection. Amateur engineers tend to stick to an idea and see it through to fruition; if this design gets rejected, a lot of time is wasted. Experienced engineers, on the other hand, evaluate their preliminary designs. In such cases, if a solution is going to fail, it is rejected before time and money have been invested into the product.

Design Process

- A customer is whoever will end up using the product. 
	- For an airplane, this could be anyone from the passengers to the pilots to the FAA.
- To identify groups, you can use focus groups, interviews, etc. Then, using "The House of Quality" (HOQ) and the "Quality Function Deployment (QFD)," you can translate these results into specific properties that consumers want.

> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - "Quality Deployment Function" is incorrectly used. The correct term is "Quality Function Deployment (QFD)."

- The HOQ is a chart/image with the following:

	- HOWs contain the engineering requirements, like load capacity or cost.
	- The correlation matrix shows how strong the correlations between the HOWs are.
	- The WHATs are the consumer needs. They are each assigned an importance.
	- The relationship matrix shows which HOWs address which WHATs.
		- If you have a blank row, there is no HOW to address the WHAT.
		- If you have a blank column, you have a HOW that does not address a WHAT.
		- If you sum each column in the relationship matrix, then do some processing, you can get specific target properties.
- After the HOQ, you can come up with a specification list.
	- Possible specifications are:
		- Geometry constraints
		- Kinematic requirements (max speed, etc.)
		- Load bearing
		- Power/efficiency
		- Material requirements
		- Signals (sound level, emf, etc.)
		- Safety
		- Ergonomics
		- QA
		- Assembly / Maintenance
		- Sustainability
		- Costs

Example of customer needs -> specifications for tea kettle:

| Customer Need | Specification             |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Warm          | Service temperature 100Â°C |
| Cheap         | Manufacturing price â‰¤ $30 |
| Non-toxic     | Food grade Materials      |
