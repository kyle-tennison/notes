# 0. Notation


**Sample space** is $\Omega$ 
- This is every possible outcome

The **probability law** $P(\cdot)$ is the likelihood of different events

An **event** $A$ is a subspace of $\Omega$ 

For example:

$$\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} $$

An event might be:
- The result is "1"; $A= \{1\}$ 
- The result is off; $A = \{1,3,5\}$
- The result is __ (anything is valid, so long that it is a subspace)
