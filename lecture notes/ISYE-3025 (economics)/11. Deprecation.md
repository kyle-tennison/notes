# 11. Depreciation

If we know the current price of something, its salvage value, and its useful life, we can calculate the **yearly depreciation** using a few different methods.

## Straight Line Depreciation

This is linear depreciation. Every year, the value depreciates by a fixed amount until it reaches the salvage value after N years of useful life:

$$\text{Yearly Depreciation} = \frac{B-S}{N}$$

where $B$ is the cost of the machinery (book value), $S$ is the salvage value, and $N$ is the number of useful life years.

## Sum of Year Digits (SOYD)

The depreciation in the SOYD model is nonlinear. It follows the equation:

$$d_t=\frac{2(N-t+1)}{N(N+1)}(B-S)$$

where $B$ is the cost of the machinery (book value), $S$ is the salvage value, and $N$ is the number of useful life years.

This reflects how depreciation is usually asymptotic. 

## Double-Declining Balance

Double-Declining Balance assumes that $R=2$. Then, we apply the equation:

$$d_t=\frac{R}{N} \Big (B- \sum^{t-1}_{i=0}d_i \Big)$$

The term $\sum^{t-1}_{i=0}d_i$ represents the sum of depreciations in all previous years. For year 1, this is zero. 

However, this method may not depreciate to the proper salvage value after $N$ years. The MACRS method fixes this:

## Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)

The IRS provides tables for depreciation rates depending on the year and useful life period. Multiply this percent by the book value to find the depreciation.

A $N$ year property will depreciate for $N+1$ years. 

## Real Estate

The **grounds** (i.e. the land) do not depreciate in value; however, the property on those grounds does depreciate. Depending on whether this is a residential or non-residential property, we use different tables for depreciation. 

Non-residential properties have a useful life of 39 years (for depreciation).

Depending on when the property is purchased, the first-year and last-year depreciation will change. For instance, a property purchased in April will have a $1.819\%$ depreciation rate:

## Depreciation Loss

If an asset is *sold for less* than its salvage value, you can add a **depreciation loss** to the depreciation in the final year. So, if $d_5=\$8,000$ and the asset is sold for $\$10,000$ less than $S$, $d_5$ can be updated to $\$18,000$. 

If, instead, an asset is *sold for more* than its salvage value, you will need to pay capital gains on that extra gain.

## Depletion Allowance

$$\text{Depletion Allowance}=\frac{\text{Usage in Year}}{\text{Total available for use}}(B-S)$$

For instance, if a forest has 1.5 million board-feet of lumber and we use 100,000 board-feet that year, we would say:

$$\text{DA}=\frac{100,000\text{ board-feet}}{1,500,000 \text{ board-feet}}(\$30,000-\$0)=\$2,000$$
---

Alternatively, you can use depletion allowance tables. If the tables give a depletion allowance of $10\%$, you would say $\text{DA}=\text{Gross Income}\cdot 10\%$. *However,* you need to compare this to $50\%$ of the taxable income. Whichever number is lower is the depletion allowance.
