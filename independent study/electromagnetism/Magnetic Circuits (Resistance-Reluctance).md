### Fundamentals

Magnetic currents are similar to electric currents, but instead of the movement of charged particles, they look at the redirection of flux.

There are three primary properties in magnetic circuits:
1) Magnetic Flux ($\Phi$) 
	- The magnetic field penetrating an area
	- Units of Webers  (Wb)
2) Magnetomotive Force ($\mathcal F$)
	- The "driving force" that propels the magnetic circuit.  
	- Commonly referred to as the MMF
	- Units of Ampere-turns
3) Reluctance ($\mathcal R$)
	- Analogous to electrical resistance 
	- Units of Ampere-turns per Weber

These thee quantities are expressed in [Hopkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_circuit#Hopkinson's_law), which is very similar to Ohm's law:

$$\mathcal F = \Phi \mathcal R $$

From this, we can see that $\mathcal F$ is analogous to electrical voltage, $\Phi$ is analogous to electrical current, and $\mathcal R$ is analogous to electrical resistance.


*Magnetic flux is usually generated by a permanent magnet or an electromagnet*, which is then *confined along a path of a ferromagnetic material*, as is shown below. Sometimes, there may be air gaps or other materials along the ferromagnetic path to influence the circuit in different ways.

### Magnetomotive Force

It's confusing how this is considered a "driving" force, even though nothing is moving. It "pushes" the magnetic flux through the magnetic components of the system.  "The MMF represents the potential that a hypothetical [magnetic charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole "Magnetic monopole") would gain by completing the loop." (1)

The MMF is defined as:

$$ \mathcal F = \oint \textbf{H} \cdot d \vec l $$

Where $H$ is the *magnetic field strength,* which is similar to the $B$ field, which is *magnetic flux density*. In a medium with permeability $\mu$ , the two values are related by:

$$\frac{\textbf B}{\mu} = \textbf H $$


Sometimes the magnetomotive force is expressed in units of *gilbert (Gb)*, which are proportional to ampere-turns:

$$ 1Gb = \frac{10}{4π} At$$


### Magnetic Flux

The magnetic flux is the amount of a magnetic field crossing through a surface orthogonally. The magnetic flux is a *net number*, meaning "5" magnetic field lines going one way through a membrane would cancel out another "5" magnetic field lines.

Mathematically, the magnetic flux is the integral over some surface in a B field:

$$ \Phi_m \equiv \iint _S \textbf{B} \cdot d \vec S $$

Magnetic flux takes on units of SI webers, but sometimes other equivalent units are used.

### Reluctance

The magnetic reluctance, also called magnetic resistance, is analogous to electrical resistance. A magnetic field will follow the path of least reluctance. Reluctance is scalar and extensive, just like resistance.

From Hopkinson's law, reluctance is defined as:

$$ \mathcal R = \frac{\mathcal F}{\Phi}$$

Hence, it's unit is ampere-turns per weber, which is equivalent to *turns per henry*. 

The inverse of reluctance is **permeance**, which is in units of *henry*—though distinct from inductance:

$$ \mathcal P = \frac1{\mathcal R}$$ 
The reluctance of magnetically uniform material can be calculated with:

$$ $$

where:
- $l$ is the length of the element
- $\mu$ is the permeability of the material
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area

> Notice how similar this is to $R = \frac{l}{A} \rho$ ; it's like the inverse of permeability is analogous to the resistivity of the material. 

The *inverse of permeability* is accordingly named **magnetic relativity**, which is analogous to resistivity. (i called it bro)

**Air Gaps** are used to to reduce the effects of magnetic saturation by increasing the reluctance in the magnetic circuit. This allows more energy to be stored in the magnetic circuit.


## Limits of Magnetic Circuit Analogy

> Applies specifically to resistance-reluctance models. Different models will have different strengths and weaknesses.

A lot of this magnetic circuit stuff is created to follow some of the laws of electric circuits for some quick, intuitive understanding. There are limits to this analogy:

- Magnetic fields have no concept of flow. Nothing is moving; it's a snapshot of how the magnetic flux is positioned through some material.
- Not all of the magnetic field if confined within the magnetic circuit. There is some leakage flux that is not accounted for in the simple circuit.
- Electric resistance is constant; magnetic resistance is not. After the magnetic medium reaches its *saturation magnetization*, it becomes difficult for the flux through it to increase; after this point *reluctance increases rapidly*.
- Ferromagnetic materials that have *hysteresis* make the magnetic circuit not only on the instantaneous MMF, but the history of the MMF. When the MMF is off, hysteresis can cause lasting flux with no MMF.
- Mixing magnetic circuits with electrical circuits can cause issues with the analysis of stored energy. For energy analyses, the **gyrator–capacitor model** is recommended.

> ^ Come back to this gyrator model, it sounds interesting.

## Circuit Laws (resistance-reluctance model)

This resistance-reluctance model considers Hopkinson's law and can be useful in calculating some magnetic phenomina. However, the [shortcomings](#Limits%20of%20Magnetic%20Circuit%20Analogy) if this model, described


The *sum of magnetic reluctances* is the same as resistors:

$$ \mathcal R_T = \sum _i \mathcal R_i = \mathcal R_1+\mathcal R_2+\mathcal R_3+\cdots$$

The sum of fluxes into any node is always zero, following [Kirchhoff's first law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws#Kirchhoff's_current_law):

$$ 0= \sum _i\Phi_i$$
