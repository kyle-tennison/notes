# 7. Complicating Factors

## Atypical Cash Flow Diagrams

### Nonzero 0th Payment

In [Variable Payments](6.%20Variable%20Payments.md), the 0th payment is always empty. However, this may not always be the case. If this happens, the problem needs to be split into two.

In this example, we need to use a single payment, with $n+1$ periods to account for the 0th payment, and then a uniform payment for the remaining payments.

## Effective Interest Rates

The **nominal** interest rate is the *annual interest rate* without considering compounding.

The interest rate (per period) is the nominal rate divided by the number of compounding periods.

The **effective** interest rate is the annual interest rate after compounding takes place.
- For instance, a 12%/yr *nominal* rate that's compounded monthly is equivalent to *12.68%*/yr compounded yearly.

If we let:
- $r$ be the nominal interest rate,
- $i$ be the effective interest rate per period,
- $i_a$ be the effective interest rate per year,
- $m$ be the number of compounding periods per time period,

then we can say:
- $i = r/m 
- $i_a = (1+i)^m-1

### Continuous Compounding

As $m \to \infty$, $i = r/m \to 0$. In this case, we express the effective interest rate as:

$$i_a=e^r-1 \tag{Continuous Compounding}$$
