# Vector Valued Functions

A vector valued function is a [Parametric](Parametric%20Equations.md) function that defines a **vector** for every value:

$$\textbf r(t) = x(t) \hat i + y(t) \hat j$$

### Derivative
We can derive the derivative (wow) of a vector valued function with the following:

$$\textbf r(t+h) = x(t+h)\hat i + y(t+h)\hat j$$

$$\lim _{h\to 0}\textbf r(t+h) = \lim_{h\to 0} x(t+h)\hat i + y(t+h)\hat j = x'(t) \hat i + y'(t) \hat j$$

$$\textbf r'(t) = x'(t) \hat i + y'(t) \hat j$$

> 🤖 (notecheck comment) - The derivation of the derivative is conceptually incorrect. The derivative of a vector valued function should be defined as r'(t) = limₕ→0 [r(t+h) - r(t)]/h, rather than taking the limit of r(t+h) alone.

### Arc Length

If you were to put a point on the head of the vector generated by a vector valued function, then trace its path as you sweep along $t$, you would obtain some curve. 

$$dS = || \frac{d\textbf r}{dt} || \Rightarrow S = \int \limits _{t_0}^{t_1}$$

> 🤖 (notecheck comment) - The formula for arc length is incomplete. It should include the integrand and differential, typically written as S = ∫ₜ₀ᵗ₁ ||r'(t)|| dt.
