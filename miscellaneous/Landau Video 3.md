# Landau Video 3

Hi my name is Kyle. I'm a second year undergraduate at Georgia Tech and this is the third part in a series that I'm doing where I derive their conservation of energy using classical mechanics.

In the last video, I showed that we can express the Lagrangian of a free particle with:

$$L=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

If we have $n$ particles that don't interact with each other.

$$L=\sum_i\frac12m_iv_i^2$$

Now, you
