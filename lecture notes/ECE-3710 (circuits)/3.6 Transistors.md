# 3.6 Transistors

## 3.6.1 Physics of MOSFETs

**MOSFET** stands for metal-oxide-semiconductor silicon field-effect transistor  
**BJT** stands for bipolar junction transistor

These are digital switches; they can switch current, create amplifiers, etc.

### N-Channel MOSFET

An N-Channel MOSFET takes the following form:

![|704x442](excalidraw-2025-04-21-16.05.26.excalidraw.svg)
%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-04-21-16.05.26.excalidraw.md)%%

If a voltage is placed across the gate, a *channel* is opened for electrons to flow:

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-04-21-16.07.55.excalidraw.md)%%

Depending on the voltage applied at the gate, the current that can flow through the channel will change. You get a relationship along the lines of:

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-04-21-16.13.02.excalidraw.md)%%

When the voltage at the drain increases, it ends up *pinching* the channel, restricting current flow.

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-04-21-16.21.16.excalidraw.md)%%

Because of this, there is an upper limit on how much current can flow through the channel.

In summary, the following are the possible configurations for the MOSFET:

## 3.6.2 MOSFET Switches

If you toggle between high and low $V_G$ (gate voltage), you get something like this:

![|393x307](excalidraw-2025-04-21-16.26.04.excalidraw.svg)
%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-04-21-16.26.04.excalidraw.md)%%

Notice that we can toggle between a current-flowing and current-blocking state; this is effectively a switch. You can summarize this for an N-Channel MOSFET with:

**N-Channel MOSFET Switch**

| $V_G$ | Switch |
| ----- | ------ |
| HIGH  | ON     |
| LOW   | OFF    |

Alternatively,

**P-Channel MOSFET Switch**

| $V_G$ | Switch |
| ----- | ------ |
| High  | OFF    |
| Low   | ON     |

An N-Channel MOSFET is drawn as:

![[image-8.png|305x234]]

Or sometimes simply:

![[image-9.png|228x243]]

A *P-Channel* MOSFET is drawn instead like this:
![|229x244](excalidraw-2025-04-21-16.36.03.excalidraw.svg)
%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-04-21-16.36.03.excalidraw.md)%%

The only difference is the circle.

### CMOS Devices

A CMOS device mixes N-Channel and P-Channel MOSFETs to get a *complementary* MOSFET.

![[image-10.png]]

In a circuit, this looks like:

![[image-12.png]]

The behavior here is:

| Gate Voltage ($V_{in}$) | Output Voltage $V_{out}$ |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| HIGH                    | LOW                      |
| LOW                     | HIGH                     |

**This is a NOT gate.**

## 3.6.3 CMOS Logic Gates

As shown above, the CMOS device is a NOT gate. We can draw this instead as:

![](excalidraw-2025-04-21-17.16.08.excalidraw.svg)
%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-04-21-17.16.08.excalidraw.md)%%

The **Truth Table** for this is:

| A   | B   |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   |

Where 0 represents LOW and 1 represents HIGH.

An **AND Gate** is created via the following:

![[image-13.png|305x417]]

Its symbol is:
![[image-14.png|301x154]]

The truth table here is:

| AB  | Y   |
| --- | --- |
| 00  | 0   |
| 01  | 0   |
| 10  | 0   |
| 11  | 1   |

---
You can invert an AND gate to get a **NAND Gate**, which is:

![[image-15.png]]

The truth table for this is:

| AB  | Y   |
| --- | --- |
| 00  | 1   |
| 01  | 1   |
| 10  | 1   |
| 11  | 0   |

---

You can make an **OR Gate** using NAND gates:

![[image-16.png]]

The symbol for an OR gate is

![[image-17.png|303x109]]

And the truth table is:

| AB  | C (out) |
| --- | ------- |
| 00  | 0       |
| 01  | 1       |
| 10  | 1       |
| 11  | 1       |

---

A **NOR Gate** can be created by inverting an OR Gate; the truth table is:

| AB  | C (out) |
| --- | ------- |
| 00  | 1       |
| 01  | 0       |
| 10  | 0       |
| 11  | 0       |

### 3.6.7 XOR Gates

An XOR gate has the symbol of:

![[image-18.png]]

It can be created via NAND gates with:

![[image-19.png|352x117]]

Its truth table is:

| AB  | C   |
| --- | --- |
| 00  | 0   |
| 10  | 1   |
| 01  | 1   |
| 11  | 0   |

XOR is an exclusive or; AND doesn't count. Mathematically, this is shown as $A \oplus B = C$.

XOR gates can sometimes have more than 2 inputs; in this case, you treat it as:

![[image-20.png]]

A multi-input XOR gate outputs true (on) if an **odd number** of inputs are on.
