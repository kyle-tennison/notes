# 5. Material Failure

Materials are assigned a yield stress $\sigma_y$ that gives the stress at which the material will yield. A brittle material has a relatively small (often negligible) plastic region, so we say that brittle materials **fail at yield stress**. Therefore, if the [Principle Stresses](4.%20Transformations.md#Principle%20Stresses) $\sigma_1 \ge \sigma_y$, the material will yield/fail.

In a **uniaxial beam** (i.e. one loaded normally at each end) there exists some shear stress if you look at it a certain way:

*^ Pretend that this is 2D*

From the [equation for max 2D shear](4.%20Transformations.md#^max-2d-shear), we know:

$$\tau_{\max} = \frac{\sigma_1- \sigma_2}{2}$$

Under axial loading, $\sigma_2 =0$, so:

$$\tau_\max = \frac{\sigma_1}{2}=\text{Max Shear in Uniaxial Beam}$$

Sometimes, a $\tau _ \max$ value will be prescribed to a certain material. 

## Factors and Margins

Very simple.

$$\text{Factor of Safety} = \text{FS} = \frac{\text{Measured}}{\text{Max}}$$

TODO: this is just wrong lol

$$\text{Margin of Safety} = \text{FS}-1$$

## von Mises Criterion

In terms of principle stresses:

$$\sigma_v = \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2}\left[(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2)^2 + (\sigma_2 - \sigma_3)^2 + (\sigma_3 - \sigma_1)^2\right]}$$

Or, from plain values:

$$
\sigma_v = \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2}\left[(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)^2 + (\sigma_y - \sigma_z)^2 + (\sigma_z - \sigma_x)^2 + 6(\tau_{xy}^2 + \tau_{yz}^2 + \tau_{zx}^2)\right]}
$$


This criterion is mainly used to evaluate whether or not a material will yield. If the von Mises stress exceeds the yield stress value, then the material is expected to yield.
