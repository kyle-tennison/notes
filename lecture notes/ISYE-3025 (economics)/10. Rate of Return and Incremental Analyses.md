# 10. Rate of Return and Incremental Analyses

We discussed [8. Present Worth Analysis](8.%20Present%20Worth%20Analysis.md) and [9. Annual Cash Flow](9.%20Annual%20Cash%20Flow.md). Now we explore the **IRR** or **Internal Rate of Return** (shown as $i^*$).

The idea is that if $\text{PW}=A(P/A, i, n)$, then $\frac{\text{PW}}{A}=(P/A,i,n)$. We can solve the left-hand side of the equation, then look up $(P/A,i,n)$ in the tables to see which interest rate corresponds to that value; *this interest rate is the IRR*.

This internal rate of return is the interest rate at which *benefits equal the cost*. In this scenario, the following are true:

| IRR Properties                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $$\text{PW Benefit}-\text{PW Cost}=0$$                                  |
| $$\text{PW Benefit} \div \text{PW Cost}=1$$                             |
| [$$\text{NPW} = 0$$](8.%20Present%20Worth%20Analysis.md#^NPW)           |
| [$$\text{EUAB} - \text{EUAC}=0$$](9.%20Annual%20Cash%20Flow.md#^e58c68) |
| $$\text{PW Benefit} = \text{PW Cost}$$                                  |

## Example 1

The IRR in this context would make the benefits equal the cost. Hence, we can apply the property that:

$$\text{EUAB}=\text{EUAC},\text{\;\;\;such that,\;\;\;}\$200(A/F, i, 2)=\$80$$

Then, we can solve $(A/F, i, 2)=0.4$ to get $i^*=50\%$.

## Evaluating Efficacy

If the [MARR](9.%20Annual%20Cash%20Flow.md#^MARR) is *above* the IRR, then the investment is not worthwhile.

A **bond** will typically have a down payment and an annual/monthly return. For instance, a *10-year* bond with a *face value* of \$1000 that returns 4% of that face value annually will have the following cash-flow diagram:

## Calculating ROR

When two **mutually exclusive** alternatives are provided, an *incremental rate of return analysis* is required. To do this, you calculate the $\Delta \text{ROR}$, which is based on the differences in the two cash flows, then decide that:

| Two-Alternative Situation             | Decision                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| $$\Delta \text{ROR} \ge \text{MARR}$$ | Choose the higher-cost alternative |
| $$\Delta \text{ROR} < \text{MARR}$$   | Choose the lower-cost alternative  |
^incremental-rate-or-return-analysis-table

For instance, if you are given the cash flow of:

| Year | Alternative A | Alternative B |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0    | -\$2,000      | -\$2,800      |
| 1    | \$800         | \$1,100       |
| 2    | \$800         | \$1,100       |
| 3    | \$800         | \$1,100       |

you would subtract each value of $\text{A}$ from the corresponding value in $\text{B}$ (because B costs more than A) to get the following:

| Year | B-A   |
| ---- | ----- |
| 0    | -\$800 |
| 1    | \$300  |
| 2    | \$300  |
| 3    | \$300  |

Now, the $i^*$ for this cash flow will be the $\Delta \text{ROR}$; in this case, $i^*\approx 6.5\%$. If the $\text{MARR}=5.0\%$, it's stated as greater than the $\Delta \text{ROR}$, and hence, based on [the table](#^incremental-rate-or-return-analysis-table), the less expensive option (i.e., option A) should be selected.

> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - The statement that MARR=5.0% is greater than $i^*\approx 6.5\%$ is incorrect since 5.0% < 6.5%. According to the table, if $\Delta \text{ROR} \ge \text{MARR}$, the higher-cost option should be chosen (option B), not A.

## Incremental Analysis

If there are three or more alternatives, you need to use an **Incremental Analysis**. To do this:

1. Identify all alternatives.
2. Arrange the alternatives in order of investment (i.e., initial cost).
3. Compute the ROR for each alternative; discard all alternatives with an ROR < MARR.
4. Iteratively compare the remaining alternatives:
   1. Start with the cheapest alternative (contender) versus the next eligible contender (e.g., the next cheapest).
   2. If the $\Delta \text{ROR} > \text{MARR}$, stay with the current contender. Otherwise, the new alternative becomes the current contender.

## Payback Period

The payback period is the amount of time it takes for an investment to break even again. You do this by taking a cumulative sum of the
