### Fundementals

Magnetic currents are similar to electric currents, but instead of the movement of charged particles, they look at the redirection of flux.

There are three primary properties in magnetic circuits:
1) Magnetic Flux ($\Phi$) 
	- The magnetic field penetrating an area
	- Units of Webers  (Wb)
2) Magnetomotive Force ($\mathcal F$)
	- The "driving force" that propels the magnetic circuit.  
	- Commonly referred to as the MMF
	- Units of Ampere-turns
3) Reluctance ($\mathcal R$)
	- Analogous to electrical resistance 
	- Units of Ampere-turns per Weber

These thee quantities are expressed in [Hopkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_circuit#Hopkinson's_law), which is very similar to Ohm's law:

$$\mathcal F = \Phi \mathcal R $$

From this, we can see that $\mathcal F$ is analogous to electrical voltage, $\Phi$ is analogous to electrical current, and $\mathcal R$ is analogous to electrical resistance.


*Magnetic flux is usually generated by a permanent magnet or an electromagnet*, which is then *confined along a path of a ferromagnetic material*, as is shown below. Sometimes, there may be air gaps or other materials along the ferromagnetic path to influence the circuit in different ways.

## Magnetomotive Force

It's confusing how this is considered a "driving" force, even though nothing is moving. "The MMF represents the potential that a hypothetical [magnetic charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole "Magnetic monopole") would gain by completing the loop." (1)

The MMF is defined as:

$$ \mathcal F = \oint \textbf{H} \cdot d l $$
Where $H$ is the *magnetic field strength,* which is similar to the $B$ field, which is *magnetic flux density*. In a vacuum, the two values are related by vacuum permeability:

$$\frac{\textbf B}{\mu _0} = \textbf H $$
