## Linear Impulse-Momentum Principle

$$\int \limits_{t_1}^{t_2} \sum \mathbf F \,dt =\mathbf G_2 - \mathbf G_1 = \Delta \mathbf G$$

Where $\mathbf G = m \mathbf v$, i.e. **linear momentum**. 

Likewise, you can say:

$$\sum \mathbf F = \boldsymbol{\dot G}$$


If you know $\mathbf F$ and $\mathbf G_1$, you can solve for $\mathbf G_2$ with:

$$\mathbf G_2 = \mathbf G_1 + \int \limits_{t_1}^{t_2} \sum \mathbf F \,dt$$

From here, we can see that if $\mathbf F= 0$, then $\Delta \mathbf G = 0$, hence we get the conservation of linear momentum.

### Impact

During a collision (1D), you can think of both bodies contacting, deforming until they both have the same velocity, and then restoring their shape (in part or in whole) and taking on a new velocity. 

When two particles impact, conservation of momentum says:

$$m_1v_1+m_2v_2 = m_1v_1'+m_2v_2'$$

Here, there are two unknowns $v_1'$ and $v_2'$, but only one to relate these two quantities, we use the **Coefficient of Restitution**. 

The Coefficient of Restitution is defined as:

$$e = \frac{\int \limits _{t_0}^{t}F_r \,dt }{\int \limits _{t_0}^{t}F_d \,dt }$$

Where $F_r$ is the magnitude of force during *restoration*, and $F_d$ is the magnitude of force during *deformation*. Expanding these integrals and simplifying gives:

$$e = \frac{v_2' - v_1'}{v_1-v_2}$$
