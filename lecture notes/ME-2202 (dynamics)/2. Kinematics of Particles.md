# 2. Kinematics of Particles


## Normal and Tangential Coordinates

For curved motion,

$$\mathbf v = v \mathbf e_t  =\rho \dot \beta \mathbf e_t$$

where $\mathbf v$ is velocity, $v$ is velocity magnitude, $\mathbf e_t$ is the unit vector that is *tangent* to the particle's motion, $\rho$ is the radius to the curve center, and $\dot \beta$ is rate of change of angle.

Differentiating this gives an expression for velocity:

$$\mathbf a = v \dot {\mathbf e_t} + \dot v \mathbf e_t$$

which breaks down to:

$$a_n = \frac{v^2}{\rho} = \rho \dot \beta^2 , \qquad a_t = \dot v$$



For *circular motion*,

$$v=r \dot \theta , \qquad a_t = r \ddot \theta, \qquad a_n = r \dot \theta ^2$$
