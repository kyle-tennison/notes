# Friction

Tangential force between two surfaces that results in a loss of energy.

- *Ideal friction* means that the friction is *negligible*.
- *Real friction* is not negligible.

**Dry Friction** occurs when two unlubricated solids slide along each other. This is also sometimes called *Coulomb Friction*.

**Fluid Friction** occurs when adjacent fluid layers moving at different velocities interact. A friction layer is generated at the boundary between the two streams. This is explored further in fluid dynamics.

**Internal Friction** occurs in all solids. This is caused by the hysteresis loop in the elastic region of materials, which ends up absorbing elastic energy.

$$F_{max} = \mu_sN \tag{Static Friction}$$

$$F_k = \mu_kN \tag{Kinetic Friction}$$

These are approximations of a more complicated interaction.
