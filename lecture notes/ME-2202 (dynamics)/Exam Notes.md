# Exam Notes


When finding the velocity of something, you will have two vectors, $a_n$ and $a_t$. The magnitude of velocity *is not* $|a| \ne |a_n|+|a_t|$ , it is $|a| = |a_n + a_t |$.

Keep in mind that:

$$V_{A}=V_B+V_{A/B}=V_B+ \omega \times r_{A/B}$$

Meaning that $V_{A/B}$ is simply:

$$V_{A/B}= \omega_{}\times r_{A/B}$$
