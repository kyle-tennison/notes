# 6. Equation of Hydrostatics



At rest, fluid has no shear stress:

$$T_{xy}=T_{xz}=T_{zx}=0$$

and 

$$T_{xx}=T_{yy}=T_{zz}=-p \quad \text{ (pressure)}$$

The equations of hydrostatics, in vector form, are:

$$
\rho \mathbf a = \rho \mathbf g - \nabla p
$$

Where $\mathbf a$ is the acceleration vector (field?), and $\mathbf g$ is the external force field. 

In the special case when $\mathbf a = \vec 0$, 

$$0 = \rho \mathbf g - \nabla p$$


If $\mathbf g$ is simply gravity, then:

$$\mathbf  g = -g \hat k$$


In this case, where gravity acts only in the $\hat z$ direction, the equations of hydrostatics reduce to:

$$
\begin{cases}
(x);\qquad 0 &= - \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \\ 
(y); \qquad 0 &= - \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} \\
(z); \qquad 0 &= -\rho g- \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} \\
\end{cases}
$$

From this, we can see that pressure does not change in the x and z axes, when gravity acts in the z axis. To solve for pressure, we can isolate the equation:

$$0 = -\rho g- \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}$$

Solving this gives an expression for pressure gives:

$$p-p_0 = - \int \limits _{z_0}^{z_1} \rho g \; dz$$

where $p_0$ is the pressure at $z_0$. 

$\gamma = \rho g$  is the **specific weight**; i.e. weight per unit volume. In incompressible fluids where $\rho$ is constant, the specific weight is also constant. This simplifies the above equation for pressure into:

$$p = p_0 + \gamma (z_0 - z)$$
