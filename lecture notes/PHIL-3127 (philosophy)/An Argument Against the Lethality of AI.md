Yudkowsky is trying to think of what a future with AGI/ASI would look like.

Found traces of a game board in a LLM's "main network" (whatever that is).

Bard didn't teach itself anything. There are linguistic patterns, and likely some Bengali artifacts in the training data, which allow this to happen. An LLM cannot re-train itself between prompts.
