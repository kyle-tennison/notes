# 7. Three Dimensional Dynamics

## 7/3 Fixed-Axis Rotation

For a rigid body rotation about a fixed axis, a point on the body has:

$$\mathbf v = \boldsymbol \omega \times \mathbf r$$

$$\bf a = \dot {\boldsymbol \omega} \times r + \boldsymbol \omega \times (\boldsymbol \omega \times r)$$

(Same as 2D so far)

Two rotations *do not* obey the standard law of vector addition, as shown in the figure above. However, infinitesimal rotations *do* obey by this principle. 

Mathematically:

$$d \boldsymbol \theta = d \boldsymbol \theta_1 + d \boldsymbol \theta_2$$

even though that

$$\boldsymbol \theta \ne \boldsymbol \theta_1 +\boldsymbol \theta_2 $$

Because of this principle, it *is* true that:

$$\frac{d \boldsymbol \theta}{dt} = \frac{d \boldsymbol \theta_1}{dt} + \frac{d \boldsymbol \theta_2}{dt}$$

or

$$\boldsymbol \omega = \boldsymbol \omega_1 + \boldsymbol \omega_2$$
