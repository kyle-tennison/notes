# Amorphous Solids

## Glasses

Glasses are *non-crystalline* solids. They are *disordered*, meaning they are *amorphous solids*.

Amorphous solids do not have any LRO (long-range order).

LRO is found only in crystalline substances, whereas amorphous materials only have SRO.

The **x-ray diffraction** of amorphous solids will produce a hump rather than discrete spikes. Below, $SiO_2$ is amorphous, and the others are crystalline. Although all these substances have the same elements, their structure makes them behave much differently.

Glasses can be thought of as a **supercooled liquid**. As liquids are cooled, their viscosity (usually) increases. This is because atoms no longer have the energy required to move one another.

### Glass Transition

Depending on how fast you cool a glass, you get different properties.

This **glass transition temperature** is the point where the T-v diagram deviates from that of the liquid; this correlates to when the glass solidifies. In reality, it is not as sharp as this diagramâ€”there is a gradual region.

As the glass cools, crystals form, so by cooling it more quickly, you can force the glass to be stuck in an amorphous phase before crystals can form. The quicker the cooling, the less time there is for crystallization.

The **fictive temperature** is the hypothetical temperature that is achieved by tracing the solid line back to the liquid line. This fictive temperature describes the temperature at which the glass would need to be quenched (assuming the quench transfers heat instantly) to achieve an equivalent solid. It describes the temperature at which the glass is frozen on that liquid curve.

## Refractive Index

You can approximate the refractive index by looking at the electron density of a material. *The refractive index is roughly proportional to electron density*.

If stoichiometry is constant, the refractive index is roughly proportional to density:

## Modifiers

Adding modifiers to a material makes its structure less ordered or directional. In turn, this makes a material *less rigid* and decreases the glass transition temperature.

The amount of modifier in a glass increases its refractive index.

These modifiers add **wiggle-ability** (I don't know if it's actually called that), which basically means that atoms are freer to move around.

As a consequence, the glass transition temperature usually decreases when modifiers are added.

### Hydrogels

Hydrogels are not soluble in water because of their cross-links.

They are this type of thing.

### Crystalline Polymers

Most polymers are amorphous. However, there is a subset of polymers that crystallize.
