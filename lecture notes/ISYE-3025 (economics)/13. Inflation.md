# 13. Inflation

Inflation makes future money less valuable than current money. This tends to be around 2-3% per year for industrialized countries.

Inflation is:

$$i = i' + f+(i')(f)$$

Where $f$ is the inflation rate, $i'$ is the "real" interest that ignores inflation, and $i$ is the inflation-adjusted *market interest rate.*

You can use this formula to find the "real" interest rate of some investment after considering inflation; it's possible to have $i>0$ and $i'<0$. 

**Actual Dollars** (A\$) refers to the inflation-adjusted rate, and **Real Dollars** (R\$) refers to the inflation-neglected rate.

Inflation only affects the BTCF (Before-Tax Cash Flow); it's not like depreciation.
