# 1. Buckingham Pi Theorem

The Buckingham $\Pi$ theorem states:

> A physical system with $n$ physical variables and $k$ physical dimensions can be rewritten in terms of $p = n-k$ *dimensionless parameters* $\pi_1, \pi_2, \dots, \pi_p$. 

This theorem can be used to show the origin of Reynold's Number.

Imagine there is a circle with diameter $D$ with fluid flowing around it:

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-08-26-14.45.04.excalidraw.md)%%

(ignore this shitty drawing)

Let's say this system has the following parameters:

- $D$, the diameter of the circle
- $\rho$, the density of the fluid
- $\mu$, kinematic viscosity 
- $v$, fluid velocity
- $F_d$, drag force

These represent the $n$ variables in this situation. So, $n=5$ in this scenario. Each one of these variables has some dimension (mass, length, etc). Now, there exists a set of $k$ fundamental dimensions that can represent all $n$ variables here. For example, $\rho$  can be represented in terms of mass and length (cubed). 

We can represent these variables in a dimensional matrix $\mathbf D$. 

$$
\mathbf{D}=
\begin{aligned}
&\begin{array}{ccccc}
F_d & \quad \rho \quad & v & \quad D & \mu
\end{array} \\
&\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & -3 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\
-2 & 0 & -1 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

Columns represent the variables ($F_d$, $\rho$, $v$, $d$, and $\mu$, in order), while rows represent units (mass $M$, length $L$, and time $T$, in order). 

Now, we need to pick $k$ **repeating variables**. It is generally up to our own discretion as to the variables to pick, so long that the resulting submatrix of $\mathbf D$ has a *nonzero determinant* (or, more precisely, a rank of $k$), it is a valid choice.

**In fluids, k=3 in almost all scenarios.** This is because fluids usually only work in terms of M, L, and T. 

More qualitatively, these "repeating variables" have some mathematical constrains, but are generally free for us to choose. One way to think about this, to my understanding, is to make the "repeating variables" things that are mostly independent (e.g. diameter, viscosity, etc, opposed to stuff like drag force). 

If we choose $\rho$, $v$, and $D$ to be the "repeating variables," we get the following submatrix of $\mathbf D$:

$$
\mathbf K=\begin{bmatrix}
 1& 0 & 0 \\
 -3 & 1 & 1 \\
 0 & -1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Taking $\text{det}(\mathbf K) \ne 0$ , therefore this is a valid selection.

Next, Buckingham's theory says that there are $p$ non-dimensional quantities $\pi_1, \pi_2, \dots , \pi_p$. Because $n=5$ and $k=3$, $p=n-k=5-3=2$. In this problem, the $\Pi$ variables will take the form of:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Pi_1 &= \mu\;\; \overbrace{D^av^b \rho^c}^{\text{repeating}}\\
\Pi_2 &= F_d  D^iv^j \rho^k
\end{aligned}
$$

Importantly, the $\Pi$ values are necessarily dimensionless. This means that we need to change the superscripts $a,b,c$ and $i,j,k$ such that all dimensions cancel out. Let us isolate $\Pi_1$ to demonstrate this:

$$\Pi _1 = \mu D^a v^b \rho^c$$

Now, let's convert this equation into a dimensional analysis by showing the fundamental units that comprise each variable:

$$\Pi _1 = \Big[\frac{M}{LT}\Big] \Big[L \Big]^a \Big[ \frac{L}{T} \Big]^b  \Big[ \frac{M}{L^3}\Big]^c$$


Now, in order to make everything cancel out, we need the exponents of each quantity to sum to $0$. For instance, $L$ (length) has an exponent of $-1$ from $\mu$, an exponent of $a$ from $D$, an exponent of $b$ from $v$, and an exponent of $-3c$ from $\rho$. As an equation, this is:

$$0=-1 + a + b - 3c$$

If we do this for all the variables, we can create the system:

$$
\begin{cases}
0 &= -1 + a +b -3c &&(L)\\
0 &= -1 - b && (T)\\
0 &= 1 + c && (M)
\end{cases}
$$

Solving this system gives:

$$a = -1,\qquad b=-1,\qquad c=-1 $$

Plugging this into the original equation gives:

$$\Pi_1= \frac{\mu}{D v \rho}$$
The *inverse* of this, $\Pi_1'$ is:

$$\Pi_1' = \frac{Dv\rho}{\mu} = \text{Re}$$

This is what's called the **Reynold's Number**. I'm not sure why bro decided to make it inverted through.

As for $\Pi_2$, we can do the same thing.

$$\Pi _2 = F_dD^i v^j\rho^k = \Big[\frac{M L}{T^2}\Big] \Big[L\Big]^i \Big[\frac LT\Big] ^j \Big [ \frac{M}{L^3}\Big]^k$$

$$
\begin{cases}
0&= 1+k&&(M)\\
0&=1+i+j-3k&&(L)\\
0&=-2-j&&(T)
\end{cases}
$$

$$i = -2, \qquad j = -2, \qquad k = -1$$

$$\Pi_2 = \frac{F_d}{D^2v^2 \rho} = \frac{F_d}{\frac{4}{\pi} A v^2 \rho}$$

Then, by if we adapt the formula a bit (which we can do bc it's dimensionless), for the front-facing area, we get:

$$\Pi_2' = \frac{F}{\frac{1}{2}Av^2\rho}=C_d$$

This is the **Coefficient of Drag**.

The crux of this formula is that, if we can get some quantity $\Pi_i$ that's dimensionless, we may derive physically relevant quantities that can be modified however we like. 







%% 
If you have an expression, like the one below:

$$\Pi = \mu^i D ^j v^k \rho^l$$

And, if we know that $\Pi$ is a dimensionless number, we can solve for the exponents with a dimensional analysis:

$$\Pi = \left [\frac{M}{LT} \right]^i \left[ L \right] ^j \left[ \frac{L}{T} \right]^k \left[\frac{M}{L^3} \right]^e \tag{Dimensions}$$

Now, we need to find which numbers to pick for $i, j, k, e$, that will cause all of these units to cancel out. For example, we see that L is to the power of $-i, j, k, and -3e$, therefore, we can say: $0 = -i + j + k -3e$. Doing this for all of the dimensions gives:

$$
\begin{cases}
0&=i+l\\
0&=-i+j+k-3e\\
0&=-i-k\\
i &= -1 \quad \text{(Constrain system, arbitrary pick)}
\end{cases}
$$

Solving this system gives:

$$i = -1, j=1, k=1, l=1$$

This gives an expression:

$$\Pi = \frac{D v l}{\mu}$$


> something doesn't make sense, i think the pick for $i$ will change the value here.

The Reynolds number is:

$$\Pi _2 = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu} = \text{Re}$$

There is a function (idk what):

$$\frac{F_d}{\rho v^2 D^2}= f(\text{Re})$$

If $\text{Re} << 1$  , then:

$$\frac{F_d}{\rho v^2 D^2}=\frac{3 \pi}{\text{Re}}$$

Which gives:

$$F_d = 3 \pi \mu v D \tag{Stokes Law}$$

> D is the diameter of the sphere

### Free falling sphere with mass $m$ 

If $mg = F_d$, then the sphere will not be accelerating. This will happen at terminal velocity. 


We say:

$$mg = 3 \pi \mu v D$$

Then, rearranging to solve for $v$, which, in this case, is the terminal velocity, gives:

$$v = \frac{mg}{3 \pi \mu D} 
\tag{Terminal Velocity}$$

## **Textbook Notes below**


## Method of Repeating Variables

The core of Buckingham's pi theorem is that:

$$\Pi_1 = \phi (\Pi_2, \Pi_3, \dots, \pi_{p})$$

You then experimentally determine the function $\sigma$. Once sigma is known, you can **re-use it for any future problem** because it is indiscriminate of units. 

For $n$ variables, you need $k$ reference dimensions. If there are the basic units $M, L, T$, you will need $k=3$. However, in some rare situations, where substituting $F=MLS^{-2}$ reduces everything to *two* basic dimensions, you can have $k=2$. All that matters is that the entire domain of dimensions are represented.

Then, you pick $k$ **repeating variables**. As mentioned above, these need to be *dimensionally independent*, which really just means that they can't form a dimensionless quantity on their own. 

Once you establish (n-k) pi terms, you can use the equation above to relate them, then perform an experiment to determine $\phi$.

The textbook gives a good systematic way to go about this:

## Method of Inspection

If you select $p=n-k$ "non-repeating" variables, you can create any expression you want for the pi terms, provided that each term only has one of the $p$ variables in it AND that the units cancel out. This means that you can do *anything* to the Pi variables so long that they stay dimensionless and independent of one another. 

If one pi term can be replicated in terms of one or more other pi terms, then it is not independent. This is why we force each pi term to have a unique "non-repeating" variable in it.
