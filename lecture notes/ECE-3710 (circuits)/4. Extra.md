## Schmitt trigger

![[image-5.png|405x317]]


This circuit is similar to a comparater, but it has *hysteresis*. 


This means that there are two transition voltages, $V_{\text{UT}}$ and $V_{\text{LT}}$.  

When $V_{in} > V_{UT}$, the circuit will go `LOW`. *However*, it will not go `HIGH` again after $V_{in} < V_{UT}$; instead, the hysteresis has a kind of "memory" and won't go `HIGH` until $V_in < V_{LT}$. This is shown below:

We can imagine why this might be useful:

Summary: An (inverting) Schmitt trigger circuit goes `LOW` once voltage exceeds an upper threshold, but it will only go `HIGH` again after dropping below a secondary, lower threshold. The same is true vice versa: it will go `HIGH` once voltage drops below the lower threshold, but will only go `LOW` again after exceeding the upper threshold.
