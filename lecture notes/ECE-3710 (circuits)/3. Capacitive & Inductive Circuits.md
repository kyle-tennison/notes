# 3. Capacitive & Inductive Circuits

## 3.1 Introduction to Capacitors (1)

The relationship between change and voltage is:

$$q = Cv$$

where $q$ is the charge, $C$ is the capacitance, and $v$ is the voltage.

The capacitance of a *plate capacitor* is:

$$C=\frac{\epsilon A}{d}$$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $A$ is the plate area (of one of the plates, assuming they're the same size), and $d$ is the distance between the plates.

If the *capacitor schematic* has a curved base, it means it is polarized. The positive polarity should always be on the flat side.

*Current* is defined as $i = \frac{dq}{dt}$, and because $q=Cv$, the *current across a capacitor* is $i=C \frac{dv}{dt}$. 



## 3.2 Introduction to Capacitors (2)

As discussed, the current across a capacitor is:

$$i=C\frac{dv}{dt} \tag{3.2.1}$$

However, you can also find voltage from current:

$$v(t)=\frac{1}{C}\int \limits_{t_0}^{t_1}i(\tau)d\tau + v(t_0) \tag{3.2.2}$$

## 3.3 Series and Parallel Capacitors

Parallel capacitors:
$$C_{equiv}=\sum_i C_i \tag{3.3.1}$$

Series capacitors:

$$C_{equiv}= \bigg(\sum_i\frac{1}{C_i}\bigg)^{-1}=(\frac{1}{C_1}+\frac{1}{C_2}+\cdots)^{-1}\tag{3.3.2}$$


## 3.4 Introduction to Inductors

The inductance of a winding is:

$$L = \frac{\mu N^2 A}{l}\tag{3.4.1}$$

where:
- $\mu$ is the permeability of the core material
- $N$ is the number of turns
- $A$ is the core cross-section area
- $l$ is the length of the winding

![|194](../../media/Pasted%20image%2020250203153945.webp)


The voltage across an inductor is:

$$v=L\frac{di}{dt}\tag{3.4.2}$$

L is in units of Henrys.

We can get the current from the voltage with:

$$i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int\limits_{t_0}^{t_1}v(\tau)d\tau +i(t_0) \tag{3.4.3}$$


**DC Steady State** means that all currents and voltages are constant. This would mean that:

$$v=L\frac{di}{dt}=0 \tag{3.4.4}$$

This means that in steady state, *inductors work like short circuits* (ignoring their resistance).

## 3.5 Series and Parallel Inductors

Parallel Formula:

$$L_{equiv}=\bigg(\sum_i \frac{1}{L_i} \bigg)^{-1}$$

Series formula:

$$L_{equiv}=\sum_i L_i$$


This is exactly like res

## 3.6 Energy in Reactive Components

The **indirect** way of finding the energy in a component is to first *find the current and voltage* through the component, then find work using the integral:

$$w(t)=\int \limits _{-\infty}^t i(\tau)v(\tau) d\tau \tag{3.6.1}$$

The **direct** method of finding energy in a **capacitor** is:

$$w(t) = \frac{1}{2}C v(t)^2 \tag{3.6.2}$$

If you plug this equation into Equation 3.6.1, then do some simple algebra, you can get this term.

The **direct** method of finding energy in an **inductor** is:

$$w(t)=\frac12 Li(t)^2 \tag{3.6.3}$$

Which is again found with equation 3.6.1.


## 3.7 DB Behavior of Reactive Elements

At DC steady state:

1. The current through capacitors is zero; *capacitors behave like open circuits*
2. The voltage across an inductor is zero; *inductors behave like short-circuits*

## 3.8 Continuity in Reactive Elements

The unit step function is defined as:

$$\mathcal{U}(t) \begin{cases} 0, & x < 0 \\ 1, & x \geq 0 \end{cases} \tag{3.8.1}$$
> You can also have $\mathcal{U}(t-a)$

The unit step function is discontinuous at $t=0$. However, the integral:

$$y(t) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^t \mathcal U (\tau) \;d\tau \tag{3.8.2}$$

is continuous at $t=0$.  The plot of this integral looks like:

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-02-06-17.13.13.excalidraw.md)%%


So, because voltage in a capacitor is:

$$v(t)=\frac{1}{C}\int \limits_{t_0}^{t_1}i(\tau)d\tau + v(t_0) \tag{3.2.2}$$

It will always be a continuous function. 

Similarly, because the current through an inductor is:


$$i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int\limits_{t_0}^{t_1}v(\tau)d\tau +i(t_0) \tag{3.4.3}$$

we know that it'll also be a continuous funciton.

**tl;dr**
A capacitor's voltage and an inductor's current will always be continuous functions.

## 3.9 Switching With Reactive Elements 

We're looking at what happens after a switch's state changes after a circuit has been in steady state.

## 3.10 First Order RC Circuit

The system to go about this is:
1. Find the ThÃ©venin equivalent circuit
2. Come up with a differential equation using KVL

If an equation has for form:

$$\frac{dy}{dt}+\frac{1}{\tau}y(t)=K \tag{3.10.1}$$

Then the solution for $t \ge 0$ is:

$$y(t)=K\tau + \bigg(y(0)-K\tau\bigg)e^{-t/\tau} \tag{3.10.2}$$

For *circuits with only a capacitor*:
1. Say that $i=C \frac{dv}{dt}$ 
2. Shift the differential equation into the form shown in Equation 3.10.1
3. Solve using Equation 3.10.2

> For capacitive circuits, $\tau = R_{th}C$ 

Example:

![[Pasted image 20250210160050.png|412]]

This circuit's equation would be:

$$\frac{dv}{dt}+\frac{1}{R_{Th}C}v=\frac{1}{R_{Th}C}v_{oc}$$

An the corresponding solution would be:

$$v(t)=v_{oc}+(v(0)-v_{oc})e^{-t/R_{Th}C}$$



## 3.15 Second Order Circuits

The **standard form** for a second order circuit's differential equation is:

- $\omega _0$ is the resonant frequency
- $\alpha$ is the damping coefficient
