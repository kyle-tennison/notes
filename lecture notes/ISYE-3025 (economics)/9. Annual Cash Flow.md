# 9. Annual Cash Flow

MARR is the minimum annual rate of return. It may be set by an executive or chosen depending on the risks associated with an investment.
^MARR

EUAW is the *equivalent uniform annual worth*â€”this is the equivalent uniform series. It is sometimes also called EUAC for equivalent uniform annual cost. Similarly, EUAB is the *equivalent uniform annual benefit*.

### Example

For a cash flow like this, it's as simple as:

$$\text{EUAC = \$250k(A/P, 20\%, 15)}+\$25k-\$20k(A/F, 20\%, 15)=\$78,197$$

### Unequal Lifetimes

Like [8. Present Worth Analysis](8.%20Present%20Worth%20Analysis.md), if two alternatives do not have the same lifetimes, use the least common multiple of the two lifetimes and assume you replace the equipment.

If you have a pattern that repeats exactly, you can simply find the EUAC for one of the series and repeat it.

### Capitalized Equivalent

You can convert a single future value into a series with...

Then, the *Capitalized Equivalent* is:

$$\text{CE}=A(\frac{1}{i})$$
