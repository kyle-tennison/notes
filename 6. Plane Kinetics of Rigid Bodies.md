# 6. Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies

## General Equations

$$\sum \mathbf F = m \bar{\bf a}$$

where $\bar {\bf a}$ is the acceleration of the center of mass.

$$\sum \mathbf M_G = \dot{\bf H}_G$$

where $\mathbf H_G$ is angular momentum and $\sum \mathbf M_G$ is the sum of moments, both about $G$ (the mass center.)

Like particle dynamics, you also setup problems like so:
