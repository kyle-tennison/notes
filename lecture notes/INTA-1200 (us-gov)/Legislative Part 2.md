Lawmaking  
- Proposals  
	- A House or Senate member submits a bill  
		- Only members of Congress can submit a bill; nobody else, including the president  
		- Bills can be written by anyone, but they need to be submitted by a member of Congress  
	- ~9,000 proposed bills per year  
	- A committee is assigned the bill; the selection depends on the topic  
	- Most proposed bills are ignored so that focus is maintained  
	- Many lawmakers propose bills knowing they will be ignored for bragging rights  
- Referrals  
	- Explains where a bill is referred  
	- The Speaker can strategically ignore a bill by referring it to a committee that is likely to ignore it  
	- Split referral: Allows the Speaker to split a bill into sections and assign each section to a different committee  
- Committee Action

	- The Rules Committee can assert:  
		- Open rule: Any amendment can be proposed  
			- Allows an unrestricted process to gut or kill a bill  
		- Closed rule: No amendments can be proposed

- Senate Distinctiveness  
	- The Senate is different from the House in the way bills are moved to the floor  
	- Unanimous consent agreements: All members must agree for a bill to progress; a single person can stop it  
	- Filibuster: A member of the Senate speaks for an extended period in an attempt to block the rest of the Senate from voting on a bill. A filibuster can also be invoked without actually talking for that long  
	- Cloture: Limits debate on a bill to a set number of hours. Sixty votes are required to end a filibuster  
- Floor Action  
	- Veto: The president can reject a bill  
	- Often, people take this opportunity to advertise themselves on camera  
	- Votes are public  
	- If a bill can't be reconciled between the House and Senate through the conference committee, it will die, but this is pretty uncommon  
	- If the president doesn't sign a bill within 10 days of it being passed to him, it will be a pocket veto  
> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - This statement is incomplete. If the president doesnâ€™t sign a bill within 10 days while Congress is in session, it becomes law without the presidentâ€™s signature. A pocket veto only occurs if Congress adjourns within those 10 days and prevents the billâ€™s return.
