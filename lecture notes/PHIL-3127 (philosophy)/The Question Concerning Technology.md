# The Question Concerning Technology
 
 Martin Heidegger
---

Starts with the idea from Aristotle that things should only be as complex as they should be.

Comments on how ignorance can be worse than direct opposition to something.

Explores what "cause" really means. Thinks about how things are vectors with values that can reach in different dimensions. He finds that there are four causes:
1. Material
2. Formal
3. Efficient
4. Final
These come from Aristotle.

Argues that what technology is needs to be "revealed" to us.

> "Freedom is the realm of the destining that at any given time starts a revealing on its way."

He argues that mystery is key to freedom. 

The threat of technology is not necessarily what currnetly exists, but it's the seeding of that technologoy that has been around for a long time. The author wrote this at the time of the atomic bomb and was well aware of the dagers; but he points out that the real issue is that technology will continue to grow. This is extra applicable to contemporary times.

Final comment about momento mori.
