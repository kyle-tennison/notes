## Notes

#### Dynamics

David Torello (9:30AM): Does the thing where you need to pass 9 of the pass/fail exams for an A. Higher average GPA

Levi Wood (3:30PM): Gets good reviews, low average GPA

#### Fluids
  
Suresh, Suhasjain: 5 stars, good time, *low seats*

Other two are equally mid

#### Def Bods

Aditya Kumar: Good reviews, shitty time

George Kardomateas: Seems like the easiest section. Perfect time

#### Statistics

ECE 3077  Romberg, Justin: Seems like a hard prof but good class.

#### Humanities 

HIST 2062: Lu, Hanchao, sounds like a decent class; fits time 
HTS 3035: Spencer, Beth, also sounds decent
