# Dislocations


Plastic deformation requires bond breaking and moving. At the atomic level, these are always from *shear stresses* (not normal stresses).

Tensile loads an obviously still cause deformation, but it causes a type of shear deformation:

The *ideal yield strength* is found from the force required to break all the bonds in a plane. However, this ideal strength does not match the measured yield strength (off by orders of magnitude).

In reality, there is *dislocation motion (glide)*. You need to break a *line of bonds*, not an entire plane of bonds. In reality, the true yield strength is a lot lower.

A *edge dislocation* defect lowers the energy required to shift the atoms. The dislocation "glides" down the lattice. We call this a *dislocation glide*.

Impending this dislocation motion tends to increase yield strength; enhancing tends to increase ductilit.

These disloactions occur along the path of least resistance. This is usually the shortest "hop" between bonds.

#### Slip Planes

Crystaline planes with the highest atomic packing density (atoms per unit area).

If you're asked to find which plane (given miller indicies) has the higest atomic packing density, count the number of atoms that intersect that plane.

#### Slip Directions

Crystalline directions with the highest linear packing density (atoms per unit length)

### Slip Systems

Slip Systems = Slip Planes + Slip Directions

The greater the number of *unique* slip systems in a material, the easier it is to plastically deform (generally).

To be a **unique** slip system, *slip planes cannot be parallel to each other, and slip directions cannot be collinear.*

> BCC breaks the ductililty to slip system relationship because its not a closed packed system

## Strengthening Mechanisms

By adding solute atoms, large particles, or other types of defects, it can make it more difficult for dislocation motion to occur. You effectively put obstacles in the path.

The bond type and atomic packing density will influence how much the material is strengthened. 

*Solution hardening* adds solute atoms into the lattice.

*Precipitation Hardening* adds a large precipitate particle. This strengthens in two ways:
- Cuts through dislocation slices
- Increases the path of least resistance required to glide.
