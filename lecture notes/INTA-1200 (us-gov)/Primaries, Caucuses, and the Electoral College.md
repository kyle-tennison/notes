National Conventions
- Summer before the general election
- Choose official candidates for the party

Primaries
- An election run by the party
- Republican and Democratic primaries are held in each election
- In the Democratic primary
	- Delegates for each state are distributed proportionally to the vote. For example, 30% of the vote will receive 30% of the delegates.
- In the Republican Party
	- Some use the same method as the Democrats
	- Some also use a winner-take-all approach
	- It's up to the states

Caucuses
- Similar to primaries, caucuses select a party leader
- People (approximately 50â€“100) get together at an event (a caucus)
- Different participants argue and debate to choose someone
- Caucuses take place over many months

Electoral College
- The number of votes per state is equal to its number of seats in Congress (2 in the Senate + __ in the House)
- If neither candidate reaches 270, the election goes to the House.
	- Each state's representatives vote together for one overall vote
	- So each state gets one vote
	- Big states are disadvantaged because they only get one vote
	- They vote until there is a tie
> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - The House of Representatives votes until a candidate receives a majority of states, not until there is a tie.
	- The Senate will choose the Vice President, with each senator receiving one vote. A majority wins
- Faithless electors
	- Some have penalties, some don't
	- There have been a few instances in the past, but it has never flipped an election
	- 33 states require electors to vote for the actual winner, but few of these have enforceable penalties
