There is no real minimum or maximum energy required to fuse, as is shown in the #gamow efficiency, explained more in [Primary Theory](Primary%20Theory.md). However, *most amateur fusors operate around ~30 kV*, but higher voltages will yield a higher fusion rate (and also a lot of new problems).

#### Requisite Current

Fusor.net FAQs say that roughly [10mA](https://fusor.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=9171) is required from most amateur fusors. 

Deriving a relationship between the current and the fusion rate is difficult because the geometry of the outer cage, the imperfect vacuum, and the pre-existing velocity from $>0 K$ temperature gas all demand complex calculations. A computer simulation would be well apt to crunch these numbers, but for now, I'll proceed with a high voltage, roughly $10mA$ supply.
