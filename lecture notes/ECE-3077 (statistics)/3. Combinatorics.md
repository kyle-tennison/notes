# 3. Combinatorics

## Combinations

When *order does not matter*, the number of of $k$ combinations

$$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\cdot \frac{1}{k!} = \begin{pmatrix}n\\k\end{pmatrix}$$

The right notation is often used to abbreviate. 


### Permutations

When *order does matter*, the number of $k$ permutations in a set of size $n$ is:

$$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$

### Partitions

Given a set of size $n$, $\begin{pmatrix}n\\k\end{pmatrix}$ can be interpreted as the number of ways that the set can be **partitioned**. 

Then, we are finding how many ways we can partition $n$ into $r$ subsets of size $n_i$ such that:

$$n = \sum _{i}^r n_i$$

#### Example

> How many different 6-letter combinations can you make by rearranging the letters in "BANANA."


---

We are trying to partion 6 characters into a subset of 3, 2, 1. 


### Bernoulli Trials

$$P(\text{success})=p$$

$$P(\text{failure}) = 1-p$$

With $n$ independent events, how can we calculate the probability of *exactly* $k$ successes. 

$$p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$

There are $(n, k)^T$ possible sequences with k successes in n trials.

## **Written Notes**

## Permutations

This tells you how many ways you can order $n$ objects. If you are ordering in to a list of the same size, this is simply:

$$n!$$

For example, if I want to go to Nashville, Charlotte, Tampa, and Birmingham, there are $4! = 24$ ways to order the trip. 

For example, if I want to go to all 50 states, there are $50! =10^{62}$ different orders that I can travel. 

### $k$-permutations

If we want an **ordered subset** of length $k$, the formula for the number of permutations becomes:

$$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$

For example, if there are 20 cars in the pinewood derby, there are $20! / (20-3)! = 6840$ different ways that first, second, and third place can be awarded.   

## Combinations

Given a set of size $n$, if we want an **unordered subset** of length $k$, the formula for the number of *combinations* is:

$$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$$

The notation for this is the "binomial coefficient":

$$\text{"n choose k"} = \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$$

On a TI-84, you can evaluate this with $$_n C _k$$.

Go `MATH` --> `PROB` --> `nCr` (3).

For example: There are 12 people on a basketball team, but only 5 people play at a time. How many different 5-person lineups are there:

$$\binom{12}{5} = 792$$

### Partitions

The number of combinations $\binom nk$ can be interpreted as the number of ways a set can be *partitioned* into two sets of size $k$ and $n-k$. 

If we want to find how many ways a set can be *partitioned* into $r$ non-overlapping subsets of sizes $n_1, n_2, \dots , n_r$, we can evaluate:

$$\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \dots , n_r} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \dots n_r!}$$

For example, think of how many ways we can scramble the $8$ numbers to fit within the sets $n_1, n_2, n_3$:

![[IMG_0337.jpeg]]

There would be:

$$\binom{8}{3,4,1} = \frac{8!}{3!4!1!}=280$$


Another example: How many different words can be obtained by rearranging the letters in BANANA:

We want to find the number of unique combinations for this $6$ letter word, but to avoid overlap, we can treat the repeating characters as subsets:

$$\begin{aligned}

(N);& \quad n_1 = 2\\
(A);& \quad n_2 = 3\\
(B);& \quad n_3 = 1
\end{aligned}$$

Evaluating gives:

$$\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!}=60$$

## Bernoulli Trials

A **Bernoulli trial** is a random experiment with a binary outcome. This means:

$$p=P(\text{success})$$
$$1-p = P(\text{failure})$$
**Bernoulli trials** refers to a sequence of independent binary trials of this nature. 

To solve a question like this, if you count the number of $k$ success against $n$ trials, you can solve for $p$. 

For any experiment that aims at finding a with $k$ successes in $n$ trials, the probability is:

$$P(\text{exactly } k \text{ successes out of } n) = \binom nk p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$

and

$$P(\text{at least } k \text{ successes out of } n) = \sum_{i=k}^n \binom{n}{i}p^i(1-p)^{n-i}$$

For example: What is the probability that *exactly* 2 out of the next 3 coin flips are heads?

$$P(\text{two heads}) = \binom 3 2 (0.5)^2 (0.5)^1 = \frac 38$$

For example: 

If I am a 70% free throw shooter... 

a) what is the probability that I make *exactly* 6 out of 10 of my next free throws.

b) what is the probability that I make *at least* 6 out of 10 of my next free throws.

For a)

$$P(6 \text{ free throws}) = \binom {10}6 (0.7)^6 (0.3)^4 \approx 0.2001$$

For b)

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(6 \text{ or more free throws}) = \sum_{i=6}^{10}
\end{aligned} \binom {10} 6 (0.7)^i(0.3)^{10-i} \approx 0.8497
$$
