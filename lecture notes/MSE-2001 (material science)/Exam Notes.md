# Exam Notes

Some general notes from studying for the final

---

- Hard magnetic materials retain their magnetization after the magnetic field is goneâ€”soft magnetic materials don't.
- Randomly polarized light will obtain a preferential polarization after reflection, even if the surface is smooth.
- Randomly polarized light will decrease in intensity by 50% when encountering a polarizer.
- A sacrificial anode should have a higher Standard Reduction Potential than the substance it is protecting.
- You cannot have 5-fold symmetry in a crystal
- A hexagonal crystal will have 6-fold rotational symmetry

	- The depth of the curve of the curve is proportional/related to the melting point.
- What is shot peening
- What is fatigue failure
- What is fictive temperature
- What is creep
	- [Structure of Polymers](Structure%20of%20Polymers.md), has to deal with constant stress applied over time
	- There is also stress relaxation too
- What is cyclic loading
- What is dislocation motion vs climb
- What is "diffusion through the bulk" and "diffusion through the grain boundaries"
- What is "Charpy Impact Testing"
	- Something to do with a pendulum.
- What is "Dilatometry"
- What is the Weibull distribution and how does this relate to a "shaper parameter" and "characteristic lifetime"
- What is phase assemblage
- What is solid state diffusion
- What does flame polishing do?
- How can we tell which materials are susceptible to creep
- Why does the Ti-5Al allow fail but 4340 steel doesn't at $10^5$ cycles at 500 MPA

- Is it always fair to extrapolate in situations like this? Apparently you can tell that Ductile cast iron won't fail under 200 MPA at $10^9$ cycles

	- If there is a horizontal line, then you can extrapolate the behavior for $\infty$ cycles.
- What is Binary Isomorphous Diagrams
	- If something follows the Hume-Rothary rues, it will have a binary isomorphous phase diagram
- What is the lever rule? 
- Ecliptic points/diagrams????
	- It looks like the pikachu one
- You cannot predict the melting point only given two materials, unless you have the phase diagram.
- Entropy drives vacancies  
- No questions on acoustic impedance
- How do BCC/other crystals change with cooling and brittle modes???
- Look up some of the polymer crystallinity stuff
- Viscoelastic materials
	- [Structure of Polymers](Structure%20of%20Polymers.md) under Time Dependency
	- Deborah number?
- Cooling rate of glasses
	- ![|391](../../media/IMG_9073.webp)
- What are the results of adding modifiers?
	- Lowers glass transition temperature lower
- X-Ray Scattering can be used to find out short range order to get a radial distribution function.
- We need to know the dimensionality of our defects.
	- Dopants are point defects
- Need to tell if something is an n-type or p-type
	- If you need to find a dopant for a compound, you need to be told which individual atom to look at
- Need to know defect notation
- Memorize the hume rothary rules
- Heavier elements will increase the intensity of x-ray diffraction 
- Quasi-crystaline patterns?
- Crystals need translational symmetry
- 360/#num folds is the degree  rotation that has to make the same shape
- 5,7,8,9, and higher fold rotational symmetries 
- What the fuckkk is coordination number
	- The number of nearest neighbors atoms.
	- 
- Remember ABCABC and ABAB
- Which of FCC, HCP, Etc. are close packed?
- FCC always has four lattice points, you multiply this by the basis to get the number of atoms in the unit cell.
	- Remember the number of lattice points for each type of cell
	- You can use this to solve for the basis
	- $\text{\#lattice points} \times \text{\#atoms basis} = \text{\#atoms in unit cell}$ 
- Don't worry about polymer synthesis routes; these will not be on the test.
- What the hell is fick's first law (ch 1.5)
- Galvanization is a diferent metal. Usually iron coated in zinc. 
- *Cathodic protection* uses a sacrificial anode. 
- A high stiffness (elastic modulus) will have the tightest curve in the bond-energy graph. 
- Remember that the CTE from a bond length graph comes from the asymmetry, not the energy vs distance alone. 
- Hard vs Soft magnets are a totally different hard/soft than from the mechanical world.
- What is the coercive field, in regard to magnetization
	- The H-intercept on the M-H curve where M switches direction.
- At saturation magnetization, you could stretch the saturation line to $H \rightarrow \infty$ 
- Thermal Diffusivity
	- High conductivity with low heat capacity
	- Proportional to conductivity / capacity
- What is the Pauling equation
	- It gives you %ionicity from the difference in electronegativities
	- $\% \text{Ionic Character} = 100 \times \left( 1 - e^{-0.25 (\Delta \chi)^2} \right)$
- 






Fracture is a direct result of *crack propagation*
