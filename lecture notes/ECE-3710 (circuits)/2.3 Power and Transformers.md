# 2.3 Power and Transformers

## 2.3.2 Root Mean Squared (RMS)

The average of a sinusoid is given by:

$$\bar f = \frac{1}{T}\int\limits_0^{T+t_0}f(t)\;dt$$

where $T$ is the period.

Because there are both positive and negative values, the average will be $\bar f=0$. Instead, you can define:

$$f_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \int\limits _{t_0}^{T+t_0}f(t)^2\;dt}$$

The function you obtain from this is:
$$(A \cos(\omega t+\theta))^2=\frac{A^2}{2}(\cos(2\omega t + 2 \theta) + 1)$$

From this, you can get the $v_{rms}$ value as:

$$v_{rms}=\frac{V_m}{\sqrt{2}} \tag{Sinusoid}$$

where $V_m$ is the peak voltage of the original sinusoid.

For a triangular wave, the RMS is:

$$v_{rms} = \frac{V_m}{\sqrt{3}} \tag{Triangular}$$

## 2.3.3 Power Factors

**Instantaneous power** is given as $p=vi$. 

The average power may be zero, depending on whether the power curve is centered. For instance, in a capacitive circuit where voltage and current oppose each other, the power waveform may be centered, and its average will therefore be zero.

In both cases, the difference between the peak power and the average power is $v_{rms}i_{rms}$.

**Complex Power** is:

$$S=\frac{1}{2} \mathbb V \mathbb I ^*=\frac{V_mI_m}{2}\angle\theta_v-\theta_i$$

where $\mathbb V$ is the voltage phasor and $\mathbb I$ is the current phasor. The $^*$ indicates that we are taking the *complex conjugate* of the product phasor.

When you plot $S$ on a real/imaginary plot, you see:

This breaks apart into:
- Apparent power: $|S|=V_{rms}I_{rms}$
- Reactive Power: $Q = V_{rms}I_{rms}\sin(\theta)$ 
- Average Real Power: $P=V_{rms}I_{rms}\cos(\theta)$ 
- Power Angle: $\theta = \theta_v - \theta_i$ 
- Power Factor: $\cos(\theta)$ 

## 2.3.8 Ideal Transformer Model

The relationship between transformer coils is:

![|261](Pasted%20image%2020250314162252.png)

where $k$ is the Coefficient of Coupling. This value is constrained by $0 \le k \le 1$, where $k=0$ means the inductors are independent and $k=1$ means the inductors are tightly coupled.

The value $M$ will also be in units of Henry.

In an **ideal transformer**, we assume that $k=1$, $L_1=L_2 = \infty$, and losses from coil resistances are negligible.

From this model, we can state:

$$\frac{v_1}{N_1}=\frac{v_2}{N_2} \text{ and } N_1 i_1 = N_2 i_2$$
