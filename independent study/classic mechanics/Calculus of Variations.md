# Calculus of Variations

**Functionals** are functions of functions:

$$D(f) \tag1$$

where $f$ is a function and $D$ is a functional. We could imagine that $D$ gives the distance along some function $f$.

In traditional calculus, functions map from $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb R$; now, functionals map from functions to $\mathbb R$.

Now, imagine we are trying to minimize the distance functional $D(f)$. We are looking for a function $f$ that yields the lowest distance. In this example, we could express the functional as a line integral.

$$D(f) = \int \limits_{t_1}^{t_2} \;ds = \int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2} \sqrt{1+f'(x)^2}\;\; dx $$

Generally, the *primary objective of variational calculus* is to find some function $F$ such that $I[f]$ is minimized.

$$I[f] = \int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2} F(x, f(x), f'(x))\; dx \tag2$$
^eq-2

> $I$ is a functional of $f$

This function $F$ is called a Lagrangian. You can see how this [eq. 2](#^eq-2) is in the exact same format as the [Principle of Least Action](Lagrange's%20Equations.md#^eq-1).

### Deriving Euler-Lagrange Equation

Let an idealized function $q(t)$ be the path that minimizes the following:

$$I[q] = \int \limits_{t_0}^{t_1}F(t, q, \dot q)dt$$

We can make this path **unoptimized** by adding **variation** to it. We'll add an *arbitrary function* $\delta q(t)$ multiplied by some scalar $\epsilon$.

$$\hat q = q+\epsilon\cdot \delta q \tag3$$
^eq-3

$\hat q$ is our new unoptimized path, shown below:

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](../../media/excalidraw/excalidraw-2024-12-10-23.24.19.excalidraw.md)%%

Note that the **variation is arbitrary**; the value of $\delta q$ does not matter, so long as it is nonzero and satisfies the condition that:

$$\delta q (t_0) = \delta q(t_1) = 0 \tag 4$$
^eq-4

We can see what this means geometrically in the figure above: in order for $\hat q$ to share the same endpoints as $q$, $\delta q$ must vanish at both endpoints.

We can write the Lagrangian for this new function $\hat q$:

$$I[\hat q] = \int\limits_{t_0}^{t_1} F(t, \hat q, \dot {\hat q})dt \tag 5$$
^eq-5

From the relationship in [eq. 3](#^eq-3), we can see that if we were to parameterize $I[\hat q]$ in [eq. 5](#^eq-5) we would get a relationship like:

![|342](../../media/excalidraw/excalidraw-2024-12-14-16.55.55.excalidraw.svg)
%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](../../media/excalidraw/excalidraw-2024-12-14-16.55.55.excalidraw.md)%%

The lowest value of $I[\hat q]$ will occur when $\epsilon = 0$. This point is also critical, where $\frac{dI[\hat q]}{d \epsilon}=0$. So, knowing this, let's take the derivative of [eq. 5](#^eq-5) with respect to $\epsilon$:

$$\frac{d I[\hat q]}{d\epsilon} \bigg |_{\epsilon \to 0}=0= \frac{d}{d \epsilon} \int \limits _{t_0}^{t_1} F(t, \hat q, \dot{\hat q})  dt \tag 6$$
^eq-6

Then, we can use the [Leibniz Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=wkh1Y7R1sOw), which states that

$$\frac{d}{dt}\int\limits_{a}^{b}f(x)\ dx = \int\limits_{a}^{b} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} f(x)\ dx,$$

to move the $\frac{d}{d \epsilon}$ in [eq. 6](#^eq-6) into the integral and obtain:

$$0 = \int\limits _{t_0}^{t_1} \frac{\partial}{\partial \epsilon}  F(t, \hat q, \dot{\hat q}) dt \bigg |_{\epsilon \to 0} = \int\limits _{t_0}^{t_1} \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial t} \cdot \frac{\partial t}{\partial \epsilon} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial \hat q} \cdot \frac{\partial \hat q }{\partial \epsilon} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot{\hat q}}\cdot \frac{\partial \dot{\hat q}}{\partial \epsilon} \right) \bigg |_{\epsilon \to 0} dt \tag 7$$
^eq-7

There are a few things to notice here. First, $\frac{\partial t}{\partial \epsilon} = 0$ because $t$ is independent of $\epsilon$. Second, we can derive expressions for $\frac{\partial \hat q}{\partial \epsilon}$ and $\frac{\partial \dot{\hat q}}{\partial \epsilon}$ from [eq. 3](#^eq-3).

If we differentiate [eq. 3](#^eq-3), we get:

$$\dot {\hat q} = \dot q + \epsilon\cdot \delta \dot q \tag 8$$
^eq-8

Then, by differentiating [eq. 3](#^eq-3) and [eq. 8](#^eq-8) with respect to $\epsilon$, we'll get:

$$\frac{\partial \hat q}{\partial \epsilon} = \delta q \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial \dot{\hat q}}{\partial \epsilon} = \delta \dot q \tag 9}$$

By substituting these values into [eq. 7](#^eq-7), the expression becomes:

$$0 = \int \limits _{t_0}^{t_1} \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \hat q}\cdot\delta q+\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot{\hat q}}\cdot \delta \dot q\right) \bigg |_{\epsilon \to 0} dt \tag {10}$$

Now, notice that as $\epsilon \to 0$, we have $\hat q \to q$. Therefore, if we set $\epsilon = 0$, we can replace $\hat q$ and $\dot {\hat q}$ with $q$ and $\dot q$, respectively:

$$0 = \int \limits _{t_0}^{t_1} \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial q}\cdot\delta q+\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot{q}}\cdot \delta \dot q\right) \bigg |_{\epsilon = 0} dt \tag {10}$$
^eq-10

This is a valid substitution because we know the left-hand side will equal zero only at $\epsilon = 0$.

This [eq. 10](#^eq-10) is known as the **weak form** of the first variation of $F$. It is called the weak form because a $\delta \dot q$ still appears, instead of just a $\delta q$.

Using **integration by parts**, we can turn [eq. 10](#^eq-10) into its strong form. First, we'll break the integral apart at the addition operator:

$$0 = \int \limits _{t_0}^{t_1} \frac{\partial F}{\partial q}\cdot\delta q \, dt + \int \limits _{t_0}^{t_1}\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot{q}}\cdot \delta \dot q \, dt $$

Let's isolate the rightmost integral:

$$\int \limits _{t_0}^{t_1}\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot{q}}\cdot \delta \dot q \, dt$$

This lets us define $u=\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot q}$ and $dv = \delta \dot q \;dt$, such that $v = \int dv = \delta q$. We can also see that $\frac{du}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot q}\right)$, so that $du = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot q}\right)dt$.

Then, by integration by parts, we have:

$$\int \limits _{t_0}^{t_1}\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot{q}}\cdot \delta \dot q \, dt = \frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot q } \cdot \delta q \bigg |_{t_0}^{t_1} - \int \limits_{t_0}^{t_1} \delta q \cdot \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot q}\right) \, dt $$

The $\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot q } \cdot \delta q \bigg |_{t_0}^{t_1}$ term evaluates to zero because $\delta q (t_0) = \delta q(t_1) = 0$, as established in [eq. 4](#^eq-4). This means we can reduce the expression to:

$$\int \limits _{t_0}^{t_1}\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot{q}}\cdot \delta \dot q \, dt = - \int \limits_{t_0}^{t_1} \delta q \cdot \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot q}\right) \, dt $$

Now, we can substitute this expression back into [eq. 10](#^eq-10):

$$0 = \int \limits _{t_0}^{t_1} \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} \cdot \delta q - \delta q \cdot \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot q}\right)\right)\, dt = \int \limits _{t_0}^{t_1} \delta q\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial q} - \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot q}\right)\right)dt = 0 \tag {11} $$

Remember, $\delta q$ is **arbitrary**; it can take any value, provided it obeys the boundary conditions. For this reason, in order for the integral to evaluate to zero, the other factor, $\frac{\partial F}{\partial q} - \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot q}\right)$, must evaluate to zero. Therefore, we can pull this out of the integral and state:

$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial q} - \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot q}\right) = 0$$
^euler-lagrange

This is the **Euler-Lagrange Equation**, a fundamental relationship in mechanics with many applications in other fields.
