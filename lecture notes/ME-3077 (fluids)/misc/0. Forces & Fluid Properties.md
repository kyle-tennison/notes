# 0. Forces & Fluid Properties


Forces may be split into two classes: **body forces** and **surface forces**. 

Body forces act over the whole body. This includes:
- Gravity
- Magnetism 

Whereas surface forces act at an interface. These include:
- Friction
- Pressure

Often in fluids, we look at stress, which in this class uses the notation of:

$$\textbf T = \frac{\mathbf F \text{ (force)} }{s \text{ (area)}}$$

This breaks down into **normal stress** and **shear stress**.


$$\mathbf T_n = \frac{\mathbf F_n}{s} \tag{Normal Stress}$$

$$\mathbf T _t = \frac{\mathbf F_t}{s} \tag{Shear Stress}$$

As $s \to 0$ , $\mathbf T \cancel \to \infty$; it depends on how $\mathbf F$ is distributed over $s$.

By definition, 

> A *fluid* cannot support shear stress at rest.

Fluids can fill any volume and have a free surface. 

> ^ Whatever that means. What is a free surface?

Fluids are a superset of both gasses and liquids:


| Gasses                          | Liquids                                                   |

## Fluid Properties

- Density
	- $\rho = \lim_{V\to 0} \frac{m}{V}$
	- $\left [ \frac{\text{kg}}{m^3}\right ]$
	- Water has $\rho _w = 1000 \left [ \frac{\text{kg}}{m^3} \right]$
	- Dry air has $\rho _a \approx 1.2 \left[\frac{\text{kg}}{m^3}\right]$

- Specific volume
	- $v = \frac{1}{\rho}$
	- $\left[ \frac{m^3}{\text{kg}} \right]$

- Specific weight
	- $\gamma = \rho g$
	- $\left[ \frac{\text{N}}{m^3} \right]$

- **(Dynamic) Viscosity**
	- $\mathbf \tau = \frac{\mathbf F}{A}$ 
	- ![](excalidraw-2025-08-19-12.10.02.excalidraw.svg)

	- $\dot \gamma$ is the *shear rate*, defined by $\dot \gamma = du/dy$
	- We notice that $\mathbf \tau \propto \dot \gamma$
	- The constant that relates these two are *viscosity*, $\mu$. 
	- $\mathbf \tau = \mu \dot \gamma = \mu \left( \frac{du}{dy} \right)$ 
	- $\left[\frac{N\cdot s}{m^2} \right]$ or also $\left[ \frac{\text{kg}}{m\cdot s}\right]$ (dynamic viscosity)
	- Kinematic viscosity is $v = \frac{\mu}{\rho}$ with units of $\left[ \frac{m^2}{s} \right]$
	- *TL;DR*, the traction from dynamic viscosity is:
		$$\tau = \mu \dot \gamma = \mu \left( \frac{du}{dy} \right)$$ ^abd0b0


### Surface Tension

$$\sigma = \left[ \frac Nm \right] \qquad \text{(Surface Tension)}$$

For water, $\sigma = 72 \text{ mN}/\text{m}$ .

The force from the pressure is just pressure times area, $P \pi R^2$. The surface tension, on the other hand, is related to the circumference (i.e $2 \pi R$) the cross section, because this is where the surface of the drop actually is; this gives $\sigma 2 \pi R$. When balanced, this gives:

$$P \pi R^2 = \sigma 2 \pi R$$

Or, solving for the pressure that would be needed *to* balence this gives:

$$P = \frac{2 \sigma}{R}$$

For larger droplets, gravity starts playing a bigger influence. 

### Stress

[Stress Tensors](Stress%20Tensors.md) continue to apply in fluids. He uses the notation:

$$\textbf{T} \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
t_{xx} & t_{xy} & t_{xz} \\
t_{yx} & t_{yy} & t_{yz} \\
t_{zx} & t_{zy} & t_{zz} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

A symmetrical tensor will have $t_{xy} = t_{yx}, t_{xz}=t_{zx}, t_{yz}=t_{zy}$. 

The sign convention is:
