# 3. Capacitive & Inductive Circuits

## 3.1 Introduction to Capacitors (1)

The relationship between change and voltage is:

$$q = Cv$$

where $q$ is the charge, $C$ is the capacitance, and $v$ is the voltage.

The capacitance of a *plate capacitor* is:

$$C=\frac{\epsilon A}{d}$$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $A$ is the plate area (of one of the plates, assuming they're the same size), and $d$ is the distance between the plates.

If the *capacitor schematic* has a curved base, it means it is polarized. The positive polarity should always be on the flat side.

*Current* is defined as $i = \frac{dq}{dt}$, and because $q=Cv$, the *current across a capacitor* is $i=C \frac{dv}{dt}$. 



## 3.2 Introduction to Capacitors (2)

As discussed, the current across a capacitor is:

$$i=C\frac{dv}{dt}$$

However, you can also find voltage from current:

$$v(t)=\frac{1}{C}\int \limits_{t_0}^{t_1}i(\tau)d\tau + v(t_0)$$

## 3.3 Series and Parallel Capacitors

Parallel capacitors:
$$C_{equiv}=\sum_i C_i$$

Series capacitors:

$$C_{equiv}= \bigg(\sum_i\frac{1}{C_i}\bigg)^{-1}=(\frac{1}{C_1}+\frac{1}{C_2}+\cdots)^{-1}$$


## 3.4 Introduction to Inductors

The inductance of a winding is:

$$L = \frac{\mu N^2 A}{l}$$

where:
- $\mu$ is the permeability of the core material
- $N$ is the number of turns
- $A$ is the core cross-section area
- $l$ is the length of the winding

The voltage across an inductor is:

$$v=L\frac{di}{dt}$$

L is in units of Henrys.

We can get the current from the voltage with:

$$i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int\limits_{t_0}^{t_1}v(\tau)d\tau +i(t_0)$$


**DC Steady State** means that all currents and voltages are constant. This would mean that:

$$v=L\frac{di}{dt}=0$$

This means that in steady state, *inductors work like short circuits* (ignoring their resistance).

## 3.5 Series and Parallel Inductors

Parallel Formula:

$$L_{equiv}=\bigg(\sum_i \frac{1}{L_i} \bigg)^{-1}$$

Series formula:

$$L_{equiv}=\sum_i L_i$$
