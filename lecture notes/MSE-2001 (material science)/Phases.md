# Phases

"A homogeneous portion of a system with uniform *physical* and *chemical* characteristics"

--- 

A phase is made up of **components**. A component is a pure element and/or compound which a material is composed. For instance, graphite has only one component because it's made of only carbon.

Components are parts of a phase.

Sodium (NaCl) has one component (NaCl, which is a compound), and if the crystal is homogenous throughout, it will have a single phase.

Generally, *a solution that is mixed at the molecular level is a singular phase.*

### Solid Solutions

Solid solutions are randomly arranged, but have uniform mixture. This random, gaussian arrangement is considered uniform. Thus, a solid solution like steel made of multiple constituent elements will be a single phase, even though the arrangement of those atoms are amorphous. 

Not all amorphous solids are single phase however. Where there are solid state precipitates, i.e., chunks of a different substance within the solid (a type of defect), you would say that this precipitate is a different phase from the rest of the metal. 

### Two-Phase Glasses

Substances with the same composition can have two different phases. If one section is amorphous and one section is crystalline, then they are different phases, regardless of their composition.

### Thermodynamics of Phase Change

*Gibbs Free Energy* is a quantity that describes if something is spontaneous. In nature, $âˆ†G$ is low.

> I should know what this is, I think there's a chapter in my thermo book about this.

We want to minimize $G$ at equilibrium

We can also visualize phase change with a enthalpy-temperature chart of a entropy-temperature chart.

### Energy Barries
The thermodynamics will tell us if the transition is possible, but kinetics can differentiate if the change is actually practical.

There are some **energy barriers** that prevent a phase transformation

#### Atomic Motion / Diffusion
Atoms need to be able to move to change phase. This means that you have to *break bonds* and distort lattices, meaning that energy is required.

$$D = D_o exp(-\frac{E_{hop}}{kT})$$ 
where:
- $D$ is diffusion rate??
- $T$ is temperature

#### Interface/Surface Formation

An interface is the boundary between a liquid in a solid. The small portion that starts to solidify is the *nucleus* which is where solidification begins. A phase will *nuculeate* and then grow bigger. This is how *grains are formed*; different nucleation grow outwards until they bump into other grown nucleations; where they bump into each other is the boundary.

The interface is an energy barrier that raises the energy with broken bonds and strained bonds. (what?????)

There is a spot in the middle where nucleation is high enough for diffusion but not too high to loose nucleation.

Faster nucleation tends to make smaller grain.
