# 1. Axial Bar

Axial loads 

### Internal Axial Force

For a force with a single normal load, the internal axial force is agnostic to the cross section location.

If you don't have such a clean cross section, you can always find $N$ (normal force) with:

$$N = \iint_A \sigma_{xx} dA$$

If stress is uniform:

$$N = \sigma_{xx}A \qquad \text{and, consequently}\qquad \sigma_{xx}= \frac NA$$

More systematically, if you can quantify the tress across a bar as:

Then, for any cross section like this:

You can say:

$$N(x_c) = \int \limits _{x_c}^L p_x(x)dx$$

## Strain

In an idealized axial bar:

$$\epsilon_{xx} = \frac{\sigma_{xx}}{E} =\frac{N}{EA}$$

where $E$ is the Young's modulus, $N$ is the normal force, and $A$ is the cross-section area (normal to longitudinal axis). 

**Displacement** is the sum of all the strains. In the case of axial bars:

$$\Delta u = \int\limits_0^L\epsilon_{xx} \, dx= \int \limits_0^L\frac{N}{EA} = \frac{NL}{EA}$$

This lets you solve statically indeterminant problems by setting:

$$\sum_i u_i = 0$$

in cases like:
