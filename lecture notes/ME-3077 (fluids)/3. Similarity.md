# 3. Similarity


Say you have a real problem with:

$$\Pi _1 = f(\Pi_2, \Pi_3, \dots, \Pi_n)$$

And a model problem:

$$\Pi_1^m = f(\Pi_2^m, \Pi_3^m, \dots, \Pi_n^m)$$


If you can prove $\Pi_2 = \Pi_2^m, \Pi_3 = \Pi_3^m, \dots, \Pi_n = \Pi_n^m$,  then you can conclude that $\Pi_1 = \Pi_1^m$ .

This allows you to do a few things;

1. Geometric Similarity: You can scale things geometrically
2. Kinematic similarity: You can scale velocity and acceleration
3. Dynamic similarity: Forces

Find: $F_d$, the drag force.

The *real* dimensionless quantities will be:

$$\text{Re} = \frac{\rho V D}{\mu}, \qquad C_d = \frac{F_d}{\rho V^2 D^2}$$

Because we can express $\Pi_1 = f(\Pi _2)$, or, in this case, $C_d = f(\text{Re})$, if we can prove that the Reynold's numbers are equivalent, then we can be sure that the coefficients of drag are also the same. 

$$\text{Re}^m = \frac{\rho ^m V^m D^m}{\mu ^m}$$

Because $\rho$ and $\mu$ variables were not changed in the model, this becomes:

$$= \frac{\rho V^mD^m}{\mu}$$

Then, upon asserting that $\text{Re} = \text{Re}^m$, we get:

$$V^mD^m = VD$$

Using the fact that $D^m = 0.1D$, we can solve for $V^m$, to get:

$$V^m = 10V$$

Because, for airplanes, the $\text{Re}>>1$, we can ignore viscous effects. 

Now, we can do a **dimensional analysis**; the variables at play here are:
- $N$ Turbine speed (RPM), units of $1/T$
- $V$; velocity
- $d$; length
- $\rho$; density
- $T$; Thrust

All of these are made up of the basic dimensions: $T, L, M$. This gives $n=5$ and $k=3$, so $p = n-k = 2$. 

We need to pick $k=3$ "repeating variables" and $p=2$ variables. 

If we let our repeating variables be: $N, V, \rho$. These are effectively arbitrary pick, just things that will stay constant. This leaves: $d$ and $T$. 

Skipping over the math gives:

$$\Pi_1 = \frac{T N}{V^4\rho}, \qquad \Pi_2 = \frac{d N}{V}$$

> Because $T$ appears in the $\Pi_1$ , the other non-repeating variable $d$ will be in $\Pi_2$. Each $\Pi$ will include a different non-repeating variable. 


If we say, for two systems $a$ and $b$, that $\Pi_{1,a} = \Pi_{1,b}$ and $\Pi_{2,a} = \Pi_{2,b}$, while also saying:

> By asserting that the two Pi values are equal to each other, what assumptions are we making? Are they *always* equal?

$$v_a=v_b \qquad \rho_a= \rho_b \qquad T_b = \frac 12 T_a$$

Then we can say:

$$\frac{N_a^2T_a}{V_a^4\rho_a} = \frac{N_b^2 T_b}{V_b^4 \rho_b}, \qquad \frac{d_aN_a}{V_a}=\frac{d_bN_b}{V_b}$$

Then, the following relationships emerge:

$$N_b = \sqrt 2 \cdot N_a, \qquad d_b = \frac{d_a}{\sqrt{2}}$$
