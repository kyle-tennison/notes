Today's presidency
- Formal and Informal Powers
- Head of their major political party
	- Influences other leaders
	- Informal power
	- Much more powerful today than before
	- Takes advantage of vague powers
- Enumerated powers
	- Formally given to the president
	- Such as the ability to act as Commander in Chief
- Veto
	- The president can veto a bill
	- A 2/3 vote can overrule
	- A pocket veto occurs when the president does not sign a bill
	- The threat of a veto can alter the format of a bill until it is approved
	- Even though it is seldom used, it is still very powerful
- Appointments
	- Can appoint people to the executive branch
	- Can appoint to courts
	- The Senate can reject an appointment
	- Often given as awards to people who helped with the campaign
	- Appointments to the judicial branch allow presidents to leave a lasting change that lasts longer than the president's term.
- Executive Orders
	- Bypass Congress
	- Have become more powerful with time
	- Used during war, allowing bills to be passed faster.
	- There are rules; you cannot overstep.
		- The Truman Steel Mill was found to be unconstitutional; it overstepped.
		- If 1/3 of Congress does not challenge the order, you can effectively pass bills without Congress's approval.
> 🤖 (notecheck comment) - The statement about “1/3 of Congress” is incorrect; there is no valid mechanism by which an executive order requires only the lack of challenge by one-third of Congress to stand. The Constitution does not provide for a “one-third” standard. The legislative veto mechanism was ruled unconstitutional in 1983, and legislative action typically requires a majority (or supermajority if overriding a veto).
- Executive Agreements and Signing Statements
	- Between the US and other countries
	- Similar to treaties, though slightly weaker.
	- Treaties need Senate approval; these do not.
	- Signing Statements are the president's interpretation of a bill.
