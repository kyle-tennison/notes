# 5. Plane Kinematics of Rigid Bodies


## Relative Velocity

Relative velocity states, pretty intuitively that,

$$\bf v_A = v_B + v_{A/B}$$

This is saying:

> The velocity of $\bf A$ is equal to the velocity of $\bf B$, plus the velocity of $\bf A$ relative to $\bf B$. 

On a rigid body, the two points remain at a fixed distance from each other. This means that the motion of $\bf A$ relative to $\bf B$ will always be *radial*. Therefore, this can be written as:

$$\bf v _A =v_B + \boldsymbol{\omega} \times r_{A/B} $$


Some things to note:
- Make sure that you get the sign of $\boldsymbol \omega$ right 

## Instantaneous Center of Zero Velocity


If two arbitrary points on a rigid body have velocities **that are not parallel and equal**, then there exists a point that *momentarily* has zero linear velocity and can describe the motion of the two points as pure circular motion.

In this figure, this **instantaneous center** $IC$ is located on the body; however, this is not always the case. Whether the point is located on or off of the body is irrelevant. 


You can find the $IC$ with geometry, and once you know it, the angular velocity is:

$$\omega = \frac{v_A}{r_A}= \frac{v_B}{r_B} $$


Then, because this point is not moving, the relative velocity equation is:

$$\bf v_A = \cancelto{0}{v_{IC}}+ \boldsymbol \omega \times r_{IC} $$


### Finding the IC

If $v_A$ is *not parallel* to $v_b$:

The IC is the intersection of 
- the line that intersects $A$ and that is perpendicular to $v_A$
- the line that intersects $B$ and that is perpendicular to $v_B$

If $v_A$ *is parallel* to $v_b$:

## Motion Relative to Rotating Axes

![[image-21.png|405x356]]

There are two frames here, the $X$-$Y$ plane and the $x$-$y$ plane.

The $x$-$y$ plane is fixed to point $B$ and is rotating with an angular velocity of $\omega$. 

Point $A$ is at:

$$\mathbf r_A = \mathbf r_B + \underbrace{\mathbf r_{A/B}}_{\text{aka just }\mathbf r} = \mathbf r_B + (x \mathbf i + y \mathbf j)$$

Because the frame is rotating, the differential change in $\bf i$ ($d \mathbf i$) is in the $\bf j$ direction. The same is true vice versa. Because they are unit vectors, the change is $1\cdot d\theta$. Hence,  

$$d \mathbf i = d\theta \mathbf j, \qquad d\mathbf j = -d\theta \mathbf i $$

Then, "dividing" everything by $dt$ gives:

$$\frac{d \mathbf i}{dt} = \omega \frac{d \mathbf j}{dt}, \qquad \frac{d \mathbf j}{dt} =- \omega \frac{d \mathbf i}{dt}$$


Or, alternatively expressed:

$$\boxed{\dot {\mathbf i} = \omega \mathbf j, \qquad \dot{\mathbf j} = - \omega \mathbf i}$$

This is equivalent to saying:

$${\dot {\mathbf i} = \boldsymbol \omega \times \mathbf i, \qquad \dot{\bf j} = \boldsymbol \omega \times \mathbf j}$$

### Relative Velocity in Rotating Frame

Now, if you use this to find velocity, you get (skipping algebra):

$$\mathbf v_A = \mathbf v_B + \boldsymbol \omega \times \mathbf r + \mathbf v_{\text{rel}}$$

Where: 

$$\mathbf v_{\text{rel}} = (\dot x \mathbf i + \dot y \mathbf j)$$

$${ \boldsymbol \omega  = (x \dot{\bf i} + y \dot{\bf j})}$$


### Transformation of a Time Derivative

The general transformation of a time derivative of any vector within a rotating vector frame is shown below. The generic vector $\bf V$ is:

$$\mathbf V = V_x\mathbf i + V_y \mathbf j$$

then, taking the total time derivative with respect to the (global) $X$-$Y$ axis is:

$$\left( \frac{d\mathbf V}{dt}\right)_{XY} = \left( \dot V_x \,\mathbf i + \dot V_y \,\mathbf j \right) + \left(V_x \,\dot{\bf i} + V_y \,\dot{\bf j} \right) = \underbrace{\left( \frac{d\mathbf V}{dt}\right)_{xy} + \boldsymbol \omega \times \mathbf V }_{\text{vector form}}$$

### Relative Acceleration in Rotating Frame

Relative acceleration is given by:

$$\mathbf a_A = \mathbf a_B + \dot {\boldsymbol \omega} \times \mathbf r + \boldsymbol \omega \times \dot{\bf r} + \dot {\bf v}_{\text{rel}}$$

Once the derivatives are expanded, this is:

$$\mathbf a_A = \mathbf a _B + \dot{\boldsymbol \omega} \times \mathbf r + \boldsymbol \omega \times (\boldsymbol \omega \times \mathbf r) + \underbrace{2 \boldsymbol \omega \times \mathbf v_{\text{rel}}}_{\text{*}} + \mathbf a_{\text{rel}}$$

where $\mathbf r = \mathbf r_{A/B}$. 

The $2 \boldsymbol \omega \times \mathbf v_{\text{rel}}$ term is called the *Coriolis acceleration*
