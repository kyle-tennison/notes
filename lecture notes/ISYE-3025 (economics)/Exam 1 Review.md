# Exam 1 Review

- In a cash flow diagram, we know that t = 0 should have no payment. However, should the last payment (i.e., $n$) also include a deposit in a uniform payment series?
- Remember that $t = 1$ must have a $0G$ cash flow in a uniform gradient series.
- If an arithmetic gradient is descending, you can break it into a uniform series (at the peak value) and a *negative ascending* gradient for everything else.
- In order for two cash flows to be additive, they must be adjusted to represent the same number of periods.
- If you're trying to find the interest rate, take the two values you do know (which might be something like F/A or P/A) and try to find the value that best matches on the table.
