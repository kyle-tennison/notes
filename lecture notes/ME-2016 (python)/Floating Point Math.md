# Floating Point Math


## Representation

A floating point number is represented in three parts.

To read this number, we apply:

$$N=M\cdot \beta ^E$$

where:
- $M$ is the matissa 
- $\beta$ is the base
- $E$ is the exponent

We calculate the exponent using:

$$E=e-\text{bias}$$

where $e$ is the smallest or largest integer possible with $k$ bits of memory. However, we need to reduce the range by $1$ on either side (i.e. $2$ total) to ensure that we don't have a long sequence of all zeros or all ones. For instance, if $k=4$, the maximum & minimum values are $15$ and $0$ respectively; however, we reduce the range to $1 â‰¤ eÂ â‰¤ 14$ in order to ensure that $e$ is never a number of all ones or all zeros.

The $\text{bias}$ is calculated using:

$$ \text{bias} = \beta ^{\;k-1}-1 $$
where $\beta$ is the base and $k$ is the number of bits in the exponent.

> I we do this to make the range work with small numbers too.

So, if $1 â‰¤ e â‰¤ 14$, and the bias is $7$, then $-6â‰¤Eâ‰¤7$ .
