## 8.1 General Characteristics


### Turbulence 

The [Reynold's Number](7.%20Buckingham%20Pi%20Theorem.md#^reyonolds-number) primarily dictates whether the flow within a pipe is turbulent. 

For a general, round pipe:
- $\text{Re} < 2100$ is generally laminar
- $\text{Re} > 4000$ is generally turbulent
- Numbers in between are transitional
- Factors such as surface friction, pipe geometry, etc. can change this.

### Entrance Region

![[image-59.png]]

When a fluid enters a pipe, it is generally uniform, but due to viscous effects, the fluid sticks to the pipe boundary. This is called the *no-slip boundary condition*. Shown in this figure, from $(1) \to (2)$ the flow transitions from uniform to "fully developed." 

The *entrance length* $l_e$ is given by:

$$\frac{l_e}{D}= 0.06 \text{Re,} \quad \text{for laminar flow, or,}$$

$$\frac{l_e}{D}=4.4(\text{Re})^{1/6},\quad \text{for turbulent flow.}$$

The flow is governed by a **pressure gradient** $\Delta p = p_2 - p_1$, which is canceled out by the *shear stresses* that occur on the pipe's surface. If the flow were perfectly inviscid, the pressure gradient would be zero (assuming everything is horizontal).  In both cases, the fluid flows through the pipe with no acceleration.

The pressure gradient drops relatively steeply in the entrance region, then stabilizes to be constant. You can find this fully developed slope very easily:

$$\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \frac{- \Delta p}{l} $$

## 8.2 Fully Developed Laminar Flow

### 8.2.1 2nd Law Derivation

Isolate a cylindrical fluid particle of length $l$ and radius $r$ that is in a fully developed laminar flow. The acceleration of this particle is necessarily zero, as discussed above. Therefore, we can say:

$$\sum F = ma = 0$$

The forces that act on this fluid are:
- The pressure $p_1$ acting on the *back* of the fluid element.
- The pressure $p2$ acting on the *front* of the element.
- The shear stress $\tau$ acting on the *sides* of the element.

The fluid element *does* deform (see p.450 for a nice graphic), but only in the $x$ axis; so the *projected* area on the front and back of the particle remain constant at $\pi r^2$. Therefore, the force balance is:

$$(p_1) (\pi r^2) - (p_2) (\pi r^2) - (\tau)(2 \pi r l) = 0$$

Let $p_2 = p_1 - \Delta p$ and simplify:

$${\frac{\Delta p}{l} = \frac{2\tau}{r}}$$

Because $\Delta p$ and $l$ are both constants (independent to r), it follows that $2\tau / r$ must *also* be independent of $r$; this implies that $\tau$ can be described as a multiple of $r$. We know $\tau = 0$ at $r=0$, so when $r$ is at its max $\tau$ is at its max. This max $\tau$, occurring at the wall, is the *wall shear stress* $\tau_{w}$, which occurs at $r = D/2$, giving:

$$\tau = \frac{2 \tau_{w}r}{D}$$


If you substitute this back into $\small \displaystyle {\frac{\Delta p}{l} = \frac{2\tau}{r}}$ , you get:

$$\Delta p  = \frac{4l \tau_{w}}{D}$$
Notice that as $\tau_w \to 0, \Delta p \to 0$. This reiterates how inviscid fluids (no shear stress) would have no pressure differential. 

In the *laminar flow* of a **Newtonian Fluid**, the shear stress is simply:

$$\tau = - \mu \frac{d u }{dr}$$

where $u$ is the $x$ component[^1] of velocity. Combining this with $\small \displaystyle \tau = \frac{2 \tau_{w}r}{D}$ gives:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{du}{dr} &= -\left(\frac{\Delta p}{2 \mu l} \right)r \\\\
\int du & = -\frac{\Delta p}{2 \mu l} \int r\,dr\\\\
u &= -\left(\frac{\Delta p}{2 \mu l} \right) r^2 + C_1
\end{aligned}$$

The zero-slip boundary condition enforces $u=0$ @ $r=D/2$, so $C_1 =(\Delta p/16 \mu l)D^2$. Thus:

$$\boxed{u(r) = \left(\frac{\Delta p D^2}{16 \mu l} \right)\left[1 - \left(\frac{2r}{D} \right)^2\right] = V_c \left[1 - \left(\frac{2r}{D} \right)^2\right]}$$

where $V_c$ is the **centerline velocity**. For extra clarity:

$$V_c = \left(\frac{\Delta p D^2}{16 \mu l} \right)$$

You can also express $u(r)$ in terms of $\tau _w$:

$$\boxed{u(r) = \frac{\tau _w D}{4 \mu}\left[1 - \left(\frac{r}{R} \right)^2\right]}$$

where $R = D/2$. 


The volumetric flow rate is[^2]:


$$\boxed{Q = \int u\, dA = \frac{\pi R^2V_c}{2} = \frac{\pi D^4 \,\Delta p}{128 \mu l}}$$

This equation is commonly called **Poiseulle's Law**, named after Jean Poiseulle.

#### Non-Horizontal Pipes

If the pipe is non-horizontal, you can update the above equations by modifying $\Delta p$ such that it accounts for the change in elevation.

$$\Delta p \to \quad \Delta p - \gamma  h = \Delta p - \gamma l \sin  \theta$$

We can see that if there is no flow, $V=0$ and $\Delta p - \gamma h = 0$, which is just another way of saying $\Delta p = \gamma h$, which is just the [hydrostatic pressure](2.%20Equation%20of%20Hydrostatics.md#^hydrostatic-pressure-gravity) due to gravity.


### 8.2.4 Energy Considerations

The [energy balance for nonuniform velocities](5.%20Finite%20Control%20Volume%20Analysis.md#Energy%20Equation%20for%20Nonuniform%20Flows) is: 

$${\frac{p_\text{out}}{\gamma} + \frac{\alpha_\text{out} \overline V^2_\text{out}}{2g} + z_\text{out}
= \frac{p_\text{in}}{\gamma} + \frac{\alpha_\text{in} \overline V^2_\text{in}}{2g} + z_\text{in}
+ \frac{\dot W_{in}}{\dot m g} - h_L}$$

In the fully developed region, the velocity profile remains constant as it travels down the pipe. Therefore, $\alpha$ is constant through the developed region too, along with $\overline V$. Therefore, the energy balance becomes:

$$\left( \frac{p_1}{\gamma}+z_1 \right) - \left( \frac{p_2}{\gamma}+z_2 \right) = h_L$$

Substituting in some of the prior equations, and skipping over the math[^3], you can show:

$$h_L  =\frac{4 l \tau _{w}}{\gamma D}$$

The main takeaway here is that $h_L \propto \tau _w$ and $h_L \propto l$. 


## 8.3 Fully Developed Turbulent Flow

A turbulent flow parameter is often described in terms of a mean value (shown with overline), plus a fluctuation (shown with prime). For velocity, this is:

$$u = \overline{u} + u' $$

![[image-62.png]]

The time average of the fluctuations sums to zero:

$$\overline{u'}=\frac 1 T \int _{t_0}^{t_0+T} u'\;dt =0$$

However, if you square the fluctuations, you can get a nonzero value:

$$\overline{(u')^2} = \frac 1 T \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T}(u')^2\;dt >0$$

Similarly, products like $u'v'$ may have $\overline{u'v'}\ne 0$ (or may not!)[^4]. 

The **turbulence intensity** $\scr I$ is:

$${\scr I}= \frac{\sqrt{\overline{(u')^2}}}{\overline u} = \frac{\displaystyle \left[ 
 \frac{1}{T}  \int _{t_0}^{t_0+T} (u')^2\;dt \right]^{1/2}}{\overline u}$$

Often, the time scale of turbulence is of importance. This is often measured in *cycles per second* $\text{(cps)}$, but sometimes another unit of time is used. 

One of the most characteristic differences between turbulent and laminar flow is shear stress. In turbulent flow:

$$\tau \ne \mu \frac{d \overline u}{dy}$$
Instead, the turbulent shear stress is:

$$\tau = \mu \frac{d \overline u }{d y } - \rho \, \overline{u'v'} = \tau _\text{ lam} + \tau_\text{ turb}$$


The $\tau_\text{ turb}$ term is often called the *Reynolds stress*. 

The **eddy viscosity** $\eta$ allows us to say:

$$\tau_\text{ turb} = \eta \frac{d \overline u}{dy}$$

It was roughly estimated by L. Prandtl that:

$$\eta \approx \rho l^2_m \left(\frac{d \overline u}{dy}\right), \quad \text{such that,}\quad \tau = \rho l^2_m \left(\frac{d \overline u}{dy}\right)^2$$

where $l_m$ is the "mixing length."

However, this is not often used in practice. 

### 8.3.3 Turbulent Velocity Profile


![[image-63.png]]


Near the pipe wall is the *viscous sublayer*, which is where the viscous shear stress is dominant. Then, there's an *overlap layer* where the viscous and turbulent *outer layer* mix. 

It is not possible to actually solve for the full-fidelity turbulent flow analytically. Instead, we rely on a few equations that were determined using dimensional analysis coupled with experimental results.

The **law of the wall** is:

$$\frac{\overline u}{u^*} = \frac{y u^*}{\nu }$$

where $y=R-r$, $\overline u$ is the time-averaged x-component of velocity, $\nu$ is the [kinematic viscosity](0.%20Forces%20&%20Fluid%20Properties.md#^abd0b0), and $u^*=(\tau_w / \rho)^{1/2}$ which is often called the *friction velocity*[^5]. *This is valid in the viscous sublayer*, when $0 \le y u^*/\nu \lesssim 5$ 

The *overlap layer* can be described as:

$$\frac{\overline u}{u ^*} = 2.5 \ln \left( \frac{y u^*}{\nu} \right) +5.0$$

where $2.5$ and $5.0$ are experimentally discovered constants.

The *outer turbulent layer* can be described as:


$$\frac{V_c-\overline u}{u^*} = 2.5 \ln\left( \frac{R}{y}\right)$$

or

$$\frac{\overline u}{V_c} = \left( 1 - \frac{r}{R}\right)^{1/n}$$

where $n$ is a function of the Reynolds number. Note that these two equations are not necessarily mathematically identical, however they encapsulate the same physical phenomenon (i.e. you should use one or the other).


![[image-64.png]]

The following shows how the velocity profile changes with $n$.

![[image-65.png|529x523]]


The more inviscid the fluid, the more turbulent, and the more uniform the velocity profile is. This is why we can apply the inviscid [Bernoulli Equation](3.%20Bernoulli%20Equation.md) within pipes


## 8.4 Dimensional Analysis of Pipe Flow

Turbulent flow, through experiment, has been shown to be dependent on the roughness of the surface. We can use this to quantify the head loss:

$$\boxed{h_L = f \frac l D \frac{V^2}{2g}}$$

where $f$ is the **friction factor**, which is determined by a mixture of dimensional analysis, prudent assumptions, and experiments[^6].

The surface roughness $\epsilon$, which measures the thickness of the rough region on the wall, is given for the following common pipes:

| Pipe                             | Feet         | Millimeters  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Riveted steel                    | 0.003–0.03   | 0.9–9.0      |
| Concrete                         | 0.001–0.01   | 0.3–3.0      |
| Wood stave                       | 0.0006–0.003 | 0.18–0.9     |
| Cast iron                        | 0.00085      | 0.26         |
| Galvanized iron                  | 0.0005       | 0.15         |
| Commercial steel or wrought iron | 0.00015      | 0.045        |
| Drawn tubing                     | 0.000005     | 0.0015       |
| Plastic, glass                   | 0.0 (smooth) | 0.0 (smooth) |

Once $\epsilon$ has been determined, you can use a **Moody Chart** to determine the friction factor $f$:

![[image-66.png]]


Notice that even when $\epsilon = 0$, the friction factor is never zero; there is always some head loss in a pipe. The $\epsilon / D$ term is called the **relative roughness.**

	The *nonlaminar* part of this chart can be analytically expressed as:

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}} = -2.0 \log \left( \frac{\epsilon /D}{3.7} + \frac{2.51}{\text{Re} \sqrt f}\right)$$

this is called the **Colebrook formula.** However this is lowkey hard to solve so just use the graph.

When using this chart or formula, the book recommends a rule of thumb ≥ 10% error to always be expect.

### 8.4.2 Minor Losses

Minor losses are losses that occur in valves, bends, tees, etc. Despite their name, minor losses are not necessarily always smaller than the losses that occur from shear stresses in straight sections of pipe.

The most common way to do this is to find the **loss coefficient** $K_L$, which is:

$$K_L \equiv \frac{h_L}{V^2/2g} = \frac{\Delta p}{\frac 12 \rho V^2}$$

such that

$$\boxed{\Delta p = \frac{K_L \rho V^2}{2}, \quad \text{or}\quad h_L = K_L \frac{V^2}{2g}}$$

The loss coefficient is determined experimentally and is governed primarily by geometry and the Reynolds number of the fluid. In some applications it is only a function of geometry. 

Sometimes, the minor loss is described by an *equivalent length* $l_e$, which is the equivalent length of pipe that would produce the same head loss. This can be found with:

$$l_e = \frac{K_L D}{f}$$

where $D$ and $f$ are the properties of the equivalent pipe.
