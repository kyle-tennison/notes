# Navier Stokes Equations

The Navier-Stokes equations are partial differential equations that describe fluid motion.

Mathematically, they express the conservation of momentum for Newtonian fluids, along with the conservation of mass. They do this by applying [[Newton's Second Law](Galileo's%20Relativity%20Principle.md#^newtons-second-law)] to fluid motion, while also assuming that the stress in the fluid as a sum of pressure and a "diffusing viscous term."

The solution to these equations is a flow velocity field. After finding velocity, you can then solve for pressure or temperature.
