# 6. Uniform Payments

A uniform payment is a function of the following:
- $P$, the principle (aka present) value
- $A$, the amount per uniform payment
- $i$, the interest rate
- $n$, the number of periods

> The interest rate $i$ must be normalized to the number of periods. For instance, if each period is 1 month, then the interest rate $i$ needs to be the monthly interest rate. You can divide an annual interest rate by 12 to get the monthly rate, and so forth.


To do this, you can:
1. use the excel functions discussed in [[5. Single Payment]], only now provide a payment parameter
2. Use the equation
	$$P=A\begin{bmatrix}  \frac{{(1+i)^n-1}}{{i(1+i)^n}} \end{bmatrix}$$
3. Reference the tables under

If you're trying to solve for a payment $A$, you can again use the table, or use the `pmt` function in excel, which takes the present value, # of periods, and interest rate per period.

If you're trying to solve for interest, you can make a cash flow table. *The red signifies a negative value here.* This shows a negative payment (getting the loan), then slowly paying it back. Use the `irr` function to get the monthly interest rate using the flow column, then multiply by 12 to get the yearly interest rate.
