# 1. Probability Models


**Sample space** is $\Omega$ 
- This is every possible outcome

The **probability law** $P(\cdot)$ is the likelihood of different events

An **event** $A$ is a subspace of $\Omega$ 

For example:

$$\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} $$

An event might be:
- The result is "1"; $A= \{1\}$ 
- The result is off; $A = \{1,3,5\}$
- The result is __ (anything is valid, so long that it is a subspace)


The *probability law* takes an event as a parameter, which is a subset of $\Omega$ 

$$P(\underbrace{\cdot}_{\text{event; subset of }\Omega} )$$

This law evaluates to a scalar, so for a die you may get something like:

$$P(\{1,3,5\}) = \frac{1}{2}$$

**Kolmogorov's probability axioms:**
1. Non-negativity: $P(A) \ge 0 \forall A$ 
2. Additivity: If $A$ and$B$ are disjoint (mutually exclusive), then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$ 
3. Normalization: $P(\Omega) = 1$ 

From these, you can derive the compliment rule:

$$1=P(\Omega) = P(A\cup A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c)$$
$$P(A^c)=1-P(A)$$

### In-Class Example

> Out of the students in the class, 60% love soda, 70% love pizza, and 40%  love both soda and pizza. What is the probability that a randomly selected student loves neither soda nor pizza?


Let us define the sets:

- $A$ = loves soda
- $B$ = loves pizza
- $A \cap B$ = loves soda and pizza

We know that the union of those who love soda and pizza ($A \cup B$) is the number of everyone who likes either soda OR pizza OR both. Thus, the compliment of $A \cup B$, i.e. $(A \cup B)^c$ is the solution to our problem.

$$
P((A\cup B)^c) = 1 - P(A \cup B) = 1 - (P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B))
$$

Then, we are told: 
- $P(A) = 0.6$
- $P(B) = 0.7$
- $P(A\cap B) = 0.4$

Therefore, this is:

$$
P((A\cup B)^c) = 1 - (0.6 +0.7-0.4) = \underbrace{0.1}_{\text{Solution}}$$
