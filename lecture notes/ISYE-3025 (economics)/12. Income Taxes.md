# 12. Income Taxes

To compute **taxable income**:
1. First, **compute the depreciation** for each year. 
2. Subtract the depreciation and other expenditures from the gross income to get the taxable income.

> The method of depreciation will impact the taxable income. 

> Tax credits shouldn't change the taxable income, although they may have effects elsewhere.
