# 2. Decision Making Process


## The Nine Step Decision Making Process

1. Recognize the problem
	- This could be an issue or an opportunity that has not yet been addressed
2. Define the goal or objective
	- A goal is a general statement, an objective is narrow (in this class)
3. Assemble Relevant Data
	- Look for published or internal information
	- Know what is irrelevant and what should be disregarded
4. Identify Feasible Ideas
	- Brainstorm many feasible ideas
	- Can you ignore the problem?
1. Generate criteria to test the ideas
	- Use this to pick the "best" idea
2. Construct the Models
	- Merge steps prior into a model that represents the most important parts of the system
	- This can look different for different applications
3. Predict the output for each models
	- Use cost/benefit analyses to weigh the different models against a criterion
4. Selecting the best idea
	- Consider both economic and non-economic criteria
	- Try using the process of elimination
5. Audit the results
	- Compare results to the predicted behavior
