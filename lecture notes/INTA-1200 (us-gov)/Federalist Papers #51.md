- People need government; government needs the same checks on itself.

- The separation of powers was introduced.
- The members of each branch should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others.

	- To remedy this, they divided Congress itself into different sub-branches (House and Senate).
- Power is also divided between state and federal branches, which is known as federalism.
