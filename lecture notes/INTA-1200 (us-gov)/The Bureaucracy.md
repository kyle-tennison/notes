	- The Department of Defense is the biggest one.
- All of the branches together form the Federal Bureaucracy.
- Bureaucracy is notoriously slow but necessary.

	- Nonpartisan.

The Bureaucracy (2)
- Administrative law:

	- Redefines general or vague laws passed in legislation.
	- Allows the executive branch to use its expertise to define specific rules.
		- For instance, the FDA defining rules about pesticides.
	- Congress will often weigh in and require hearings to amend the rules.
- Bureaucracy argued for anonymity.
- Bureaucrats have leverage over Congress and the president to push for new policies by using their expertise.
- Bureaucrats at high levels are appointed by the president; Congress needs to approve the appointment.
- Pulling funding can be used to make these departments act in a particular way.
