If we are interested in finding the *future value* of some principle over time (or solve for some unknown), there are three ways to go about it:

1. Directly apply the equation
	- Use $F=P(1+i)^n$ where $F$ is the future value, $P$ is the principle value, $i$ is the interest rate, and $n$ is the number of periods.
2. Look up in the tables
	- The tables [here](https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/430448/pages/interest-factor-tables?module_item_id=4827944) enumerate different values.
	- Depending on what you are trying to find (P or F), take that value (x=P or F) and multiply it by the corresponding column
		- For example, if I start with $500, I would multiply the item under the "Compound Amount Factor Find F Given P" by this $500 to get the future value. 
		- If, instead, my future value were $500, I would multiply the item under the "Present Worth Factor Find P Given F" by this $500 to get the present worth.
3. Use the excel function
	- If finding a future value, you can use the `fv` function in excel.
		- `rate` is the interest rate 
		- `nper` is the number of periods
		- Put `0` for the `pmt` argument, because single payment doesn't account for regular payments.
		- `[pv]` is the present value
	- If finding a present value, you can use the `pv` function in excel
		- `[fv]` is the future value
		- All other arguments are identical
