# 2. Independence


Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if:

$$P(A \cap B ) = P(A) P(B)$$


If $X \subset Y$, then the two are not independent. It really comes down to: if knowing one probability influences the probability of something else, then the two are not independent. 


#### Example:

Given:

$$B_1 = B_2 = \{0, 1\}$$

$$P(B_1=0)=P(B_2=0)= 0.5$$

This is equivalent to a coin flip pretty much. $B_1$ and $B_2$ are independent. Then, look at:

$$Z = B_1 \oplus B_2$$

Would this be independent of $B_1$ and $B_2$? 


| $B_1$ | $B_2$ | $Z$ |
| ----- | ----- | --- |
| 0     | 0     | 0   |
| 0     | 1     | 1   |
| 1     | 0     | 1   |
| 1     | 1     | 0   |

From this table, it's evident that $P(Z=0)=0.5$. Now, notice that if you are told what $B_1$ or (but not both) $B_2$ is, you gain no new information about the probability of $Z$; it will still be a 50% chance. For this reason, Z is actually independent of $B_1$ and $B_2$

You can have pairwise independence, but not group independence. However, the metric of independence remains unchanged for multiple probabilities:

$$P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \dots \cap A_n) = P(A_1)P(A_2)\cdots P(A_n)$$

> So, pairwise independence doesn't guarantee group independence, but does group independence guarantee pair independence?


### Conditional Probability

Conditional probability gives the probability of an event $A$, given the occurrence of an event $B$. 

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$

It's important to note:

$$P(A|B) \ne P(B|A)$$
