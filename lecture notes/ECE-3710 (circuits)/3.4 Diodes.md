# 3.4 Diodes

## 3.4.1 Introduction to PN Junctions

Silicon atoms can be arranged into a lattice where they share electrons. This lattice can be changed via **doping**, which adds impurities to the lattice. These impurities change the properties of the material; boron, for instance, will add holes to the structure.

A **hole** is a spot in the lattice where an additional electron can fit. **P-Type** semiconductors have these extra holes. **N-Type** semiconductors, on the other hand, have extra free electrons; this can be done with impurities like phosphorus. 

At the junction between a P-Type and an N-Type semiconductor, called a **PN Junction**, the free electrons in the P-Type semiconductor will be able to jump to the holes in the N-Type semiconductor if there is enough energy available.
> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - In a PN junction, electrons are actually the majority carriers in the N-Type region and diffuse from the N-Type side to recombine with holes in the P-Type side.

After this diffusion happens, the P side grows negative after electrons migrate and the N side grows positive after it loses its electrons. The region where this takes place is called the **Depletion Region,** where all the electron-hole movement has taken place (and eventually reached steady state).

Now, if an external source is connected to this PN junction, an opposing electric field exists:

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-04-20-18.56.06.excalidraw.md)%%

In this scenario, current can flow through the PN junction.

Now, if we flip the direction of the source, we see that:

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-04-20-19.00.59.excalidraw.md)%%

In this scenario, the induced electric field is in the same direction as the electric field from the depletion region. Because of this, the depletion region actually grows. Holes and electrons are discouraged from moving, and no current is conducted.

This is how a **diode** works. We end up with a curve like this:

### 3.4.2 Diode Behavior

Diodes
- Block current flow in certain directions
- Can be used to rectify AC to DC
- Can regulate voltage
- Can be used to create LEDs

Diodes are simplified to be:

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-04-20-19.09.40.excalidraw.md)%%

Often, the turn-on voltage is neglected.

They do that

### 3.4.4 Assumed States Method

1. Identify all possible diode state combinations
2. Analyze the circuit at each state 
3. See which combination is consistent with $i_d > 0$

### 3.4.5 Ideal Diode + Voltage Source Model

You can model the voltage drop of a diode by adding a reverse polarity voltage source that decreases the voltage that goes into the diode.
