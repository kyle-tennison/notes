Metaphorology is the study of metaphors.

Metaphors are somewhat like art in the way that they become popular across communities. Metaphors that are commonly used can reveal how a community thinks.

Metaphors can be implicit.

An exploration of worldviews and the relationship between us and that worldview.

Blumenberg wants to see how metaphors can reveal changes in culture.

He thinks that there is a hidden "subterranean thought" that can only be discovered by metaphorological exploration.

Well-reasoned, true arguments will not always convince people. Sometimes, "truth" is analogous to belief, in that it is very emotional. The evidence needs to be compelling for it to be accepted.

Stoicism, which focuses on logos, is a good way to explore truth without necessarily depending on emotion.

> 'Truth' is simply the name we give to the fact that particular representations prevail over others in human consciousness

In this representation, Truth is whatever is the most compelling. This is in line with how we often think of truth in the contemporary world.
