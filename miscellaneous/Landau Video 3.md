# Landau Video 3

Hi, my name is Kyle. I'm a second-year undergraduate at Georgia Tech, and this is the third part in a series in which I derive the conservation of energy using classical mechanics.

In the last video, I showed that we can express the Lagrangian of a free particle as:

$$L=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

If we have $n$ particles that do not interact with each other,

$$L=\sum_i\frac12m_iv_i^2$$

Now, you
