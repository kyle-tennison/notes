# Ideal Gas Systems

If a gas composed of sub-gasses behaves like an ideal gas, and each constituent gas also behaves ideally, we can make some assumptions.

We can say that the *mass fraction* of a constituent gas relative to the mass of all the gas is:

$$ m_{f} = \frac{m_i}{m} \tag{Mass Fraction}$$

If done correctly, all mass fractions should add up to one ($1 = \sum_i m_{f,i}$). You can apply the same logic to derive a *mole fraction*, which is:

$$y_i = \frac{n_i}n \tag{Mole Fraction}$$

Again, the sum of all mole fractions will be $1$.

The *apparent molecular mass* (i.e., the average molecular weight of the compound gas) can be found by taking the weighted average of all the molar masses of the constituent gasses by their mole fraction:

$$M =\sum _i = y_iM_i$$


### Modeling Ideal Gasses

There are popular two ways we can think about ideal gasses. One is the **Dalton model**, which assumes molecules *do not interact* with each other. The other is the **Amagat model**, which assumes that gas molecules *do interact* with each other.

#### Dalton Model

Because this model *assumes that the interaction between molecules are negligible*, we can say the gasses "overlap" without touching each other. Thus, we can imagine how two gasses occupying the same chamber will both exert a pressure on the walls of the chamber. This total pressure could then be represented as a sum of *partial pressures* of the constituent gasses. 

The partial pressure of a gas, given the number of moles it occupies, is:

$$p_i = \frac{n_i\bar R T}{V} \tag{Partial Pressure}$$

This partial pressure can be expressed as a fraction of the total pressure using the mole ratio $y_i$:

$$p_i = y_ip, \text{\;\;\;such that\;\;\;\;}\sum_ip_i = p$$

Notice that, *if the mole fraction remains constant* through the system, we can say

$$ \frac{p_{i,1}}{p_{i,2}} = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$$

#### Amagat Model 

The Amagat Model makes a different assumption than the dalton model. Instead of assuming that all particles are at the same volume and temperature, *it assumes all particles are at the same pressure and temperature*â€”constituent gasses are not assumed to occupy the entire model. An artifact of this is that the amagat model operates with *partial volumes instead of partial pressures*.



## Evaluating U, H, S, and specific heats

You can represent the internal energy and enthalpy of a gas from its constituent gasses using the mole fractions:

$$\bar u = \sum _i y_i\bar u_i \text{\;\; and\;\;\;} \bar h = \sum_i y_i \bar h$$

This also carries over to specific heats:

$$\bar c_v = \sum_i y_i \bar c_{v,i} \text{\;\;\;and\;\;\;}\bar c_p = \sum_i y_i \bar c_{p,i}$$


> Remember that:
> $$\bar c_v = \bar c_p + \bar R \tag{ideal gas}$$

And yet again, you can follow this logic for entropy:

$$ \bar s = \sum _i y_i \bar s_i$$

Each of these quantities are the *mole average* of the compound gas. 

> If $\Delta \bar s = 0$, it does not necessarily mean that $\Delta \bar s_i = 0$ for all constituent gasses; individual substances may increase in entropy and others may decrease. 


> When mixing two gasses, entropy is generated. Fundamentally, you are increasing the disorder by mixing two initially separated gases, but you can also quantify this using a second-law analysis.

Psychrometry is the study of moist error. This has applications in weather and with air conditioning. 

As discussed with humidity, the **humidity ratio** is:

$$ \omega = \frac{m_v}{m_a}$$ 
This is the fraction of the mass of water vapor in the mass of air.

You can express this with the ideal gas law:

$$ \omega = \frac{m_v}{m_a} =\frac{M_vP_v \frac{V}{\bar R T}}{M_a P_a \frac{V}{\bar R T}}= \frac{M_v P_v}{M_aP_a} \approx 0.622 \frac{P_v}{P-P_V}$$

where:
- $P_A$ and $P_V$ are the partial pressures of air and vapor respectivey, where $P_A=P-P_V$ 
- $M_V$ and $M_a$ are the molecular weights of water vapor and air

You can also express **relative humidity** as:

$$ \phi = \frac{P_V|_{T,P}}{P_g|_T}$$

where
- $P_g$ is the dew point

Using an mass balance, you can say:

$$\dot m_{air, 1} = \dot m_{air, 2}$$ 
$$\dot m_{v, 1} + \dot m_{w} = \dot m_{v, 2} $$

$$ \omega_1 = \frac{\dot m_{v,1}}{\dot m_{a, 1}}, \ \omega_1 = \frac{\dot m_{v,2}}{\dot m_{a, 2}}$$

$$ \dot m_w = \dot m_a (\omega_2 - \omega _1) $$

Then, using a control volume energy balance:

$$\cancel {\frac{dE}{dt}} = 0 = \dot Q_{cv} - \cancel{\dot W_{cv}}+\sum _im_ih_i - \sum _e m_e h_e$$

$$ 0 = \dot Q_{cv} + \dot m_a h_{a,1}+\dot m_{v,1}+\dot m_w h_w - \dot m_ah_{a,2}, - \dot m_{v,2}h_{v,2}$$

Then, by substituting the mass relationships shown above, and *assuming that the water vapor's enthalpy is approximately that of a saturated vapor*, we can write this as: 

$$ 0 =\dot Q_{cv} + \dot m_a [(h_{a,1}-h_{a,2})+\omega_1h_{g,1} + (\omega_2 - \omega _1)h_w-\omega_2 h_{g,2}]$$

The *enthalpy of moist air* is:

$$h = (h_a+\omega h_v)_1$$


When heating air, the humidity ratio does not necessarily change. If no water or air is added/removed, it will remain constant. So, if you are heating moist air, you can trace between temperatures along a horizontal humidity ratio line.
