# 3.3 Active Filters

## 3.3.1 First-Order [Lowpass Filter](2.2%20Frequency%20Response.md#Lowpass%20Filter%20Properties)

A first-order filter has the transfer function:

$$H(\omega) = K_{DC} \frac{1}{\tau j \omega + 1}$$

Here, $\omega_b$ is the bandwidth, given by $\omega_b = \tau^{-1}$, and the DC gain is $H(0)=K_{DC}$.

To convert a passive lowpass filter into an active lowpass filter, you can add a [Buffer Circuit](3.2%20Op%20Amps.md#3.2.2%20Buffer%20Circuits) to either the input or the output.

Alternatively, you can move the op-amp into the feedback loop of the filter, isolating both the input and the output:

The output of this filter is given by:

$$V_o= -\frac{R_f}{R_1}\cdot \frac{1}{R_fCj\omega +1} V_{in}$$

The DC gain of this filter is $K_{DC}=-\frac{R_f}{R_1}$, the bandwidth is $\omega_b = \frac{1}{R_fC_f}$, and the transfer function is:

$$H(\omega) = -\frac{R_f}{R_1}\frac{1}{(R_fCj\omega + 1)}$$
$$|H(\omega)| = \frac{R_f}{R_1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{(R_fC_f\omega)^2+1}}$$
$$\angle H(\omega) = 180 - \text{arctan}(R_fC_f\omega )$$

> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - There is an inconsistency in the capacitor notation. The transfer function uses "C" in the term "R_fCj\omega" while the bandwidth and phase equations use "C_f". Please ensure consistent notation (either "C" or "C_f") throughout.

For reference, the [Bode Plot Conversion](2.2%20Frequency%20Response.md#^bode-plot-conversion) for decibel scales is provided here.

### 3.3.2 First-Order [Highpass Filters](2.2%20Frequency%20Response.md)

$$H(\omega) = \frac{Kj \omega}{\tau j \omega + 1}$$

The corner frequency is $\omega_c = \frac{1}{\tau}$, and the passband gain is $K_{PB}=K/\tau$.

An inverting highpass filter is shown below:

The equation for the output voltage is:

$$V_o = \frac{-R_fCj\omega}{(R_1Cj\omega + 1)}V_{in}$$

Here, the corner frequency is $\omega_c = \frac{1}{R_1C}$.

The transfer function is:

$$H(\omega) = \frac{-R_fCj\omega}{R_1Cj\omega + 1}$$
$$|H(\omega)| = \frac{R_fC\omega}{\sqrt{(R_1C\omega)^2+1}}$$
$$\angle H(\omega) = -90^{\circ} - \text{arctan}(R_1C\omega)$$

The passband gain, as $\omega \to \infty$, is $-R_f/R_1$.

> Remember, Hz needs to be converted to rad/s.

### 3.3.3 Cascaded First-Order Circuits

The transfer functions in terms of frequency (instead of $\omega$) are as follows:

For a lowpass filter:

$$H(f)=K_{DC}\frac{1}{\frac{jf}{f_0}+1}$$
where $\omega_b = \omega_0 = 2 \pi f_0$.

For a highpass filter:

$$H(f)= K_{PB} \frac{\frac{jf}{f_0}}{\frac{jf}{f_0}+1}$$

where $\omega_c = \omega_0 = 2 \pi f_0$.

**Cascading filters** means applying the output of one filter as the input to a new filter. The transfer function of the cascaded filter is the product of the constituent filters:

$$H_c(\omega) = \prod_i H_i(\omega)$$

You will often get [Bandpass and Notch Filters](2.2%20Frequency%20Response.md#2.2.11%20Bandpass%20and%20Notch%20Filters) from doing this.

When combining a lowpass and a highpass filter with corner frequencies of $f_l$ and $f_h$, respectively, the resultant ideal bandpass will have the following properties:

$$f_0 = \sqrt{f_l f_h}$$
$$Q = \frac{\sqrt{f_l f_h}}{f_l + f_h}$$

$$\text{BW} = f_l + f_h$$

> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - For an ideal bandpass filter formed by cascading a lowpass and a highpass filter, the bandwidth (BW) should be defined as the difference between the high and low corner frequencies (i.e., $BW = f_h - f_l$), not their sum, and Q should be $Q = f_0 / (f_h - f_l)$.
