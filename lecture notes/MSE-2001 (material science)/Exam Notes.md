# Exam Notes

Some general notes from studying for the final

---

- Hard magnetic materials retain their magnetization after the magnetic field is goneâ€”soft magnetic materials don't.
- Randomly polarized light will obtain a preferential polarization after reflection, even if the surface is smooth.
- Randomly polarized light will decrease in intensity by 50% when encountering a polarizer.
- A sacrificial anode should have a higher Standard Reduction Potential than the substance it is protecting.
- You cannot have 5-fold symmetry in a crystal
- A hexagonal crystal will have 6-fold rotational symmetry

- What is "diffusion through the bulk" and "diffusion through the grain boundaries"
- What is "Charpy Impact Testing"
- What is "Dilatometry"
- What is the Weibull distribution and how does this relate to a "shaper parameter" and "characteristic lifetime"
- What is phase assemblage
- What is solid state diffusion
- What does flame polishing do?

- Is it always fair to extrapolate in situations like this? Apparently you can tell that Ductile cast iron won't fail under 200 MPA at $10^9$ cycles
