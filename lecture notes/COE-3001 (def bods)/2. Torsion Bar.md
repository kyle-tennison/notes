# 2. Torsion Bar


Torsion is shown in two different ways:

The double arrow means twisting in accordance to the right hand rule. 

Like axial loads, there is a **internal twisting moment** that gives the torsion as a function of the length along the rod:

$$T(x)$$


The following are the basic loading cases:
1. Tip moment: a moment at the end of the rod
2. Discrete moments: a discrete number of moments at any point across the rod
3. Distributed moments: a continuous moment $m_x$ distributed across the length of the rod.

The sign convention is:

### Shear Stress

Torsion is the macroscopic result of shear stresses.

As the figure mentions, the shear stress in an axisymmetric cross-section will be a *linear function* of the radius $r$:

$$\tau (r) = cr \qquad \text{where} \quad c=\text{const}$$

The infinitesimal amount of torsion from a small part of the cross section like this:

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-09-15-19.20.40.excalidraw.md)%%

is given by:

$$dT = \underbrace{\tau (r)\cdot dA}_{\text{Force}} \quad \overbrace{r}^{\text{Radius}} = cr^2\,dA$$

Integrating this gives:

$$T = \iint cr^2 dA = cI_p$$

where $I_p$ is the **polar moment of inertia**. To be explicit:

$$\underbrace{I_p = \iint r^2 dA =\iint x^2+y^2 dA = I_x +I_y}_{\text{Polar moment of inertia}}$$


This let's us say that: 

$$c = \frac{T}{I_p}\qquad\text{therefore,} \quad \tau(r) = \frac{Tr}{I_p}$$

If you instead need to find the shear stress given torsion, the alternate form of this equation may be useful:

$$\tau = \frac{T(x)r}{I_p(x)}$$

The maximum torsion evidently occurs at the outer edge of the cross section. Use this fact if you need to determine if a material will yield/fail for a given moment.
