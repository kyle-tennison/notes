# Beams
Beams are members that specifically *resist bending*. Their loads are typically applied perpendicular to their longitudinal axis.

Many beam problems will be statically indeterminate, so it's important to look at the number of knowns versus the number of unknowns. 

> In case I forget, statically determinate means $n_{reactions}-n_{equations}=0$ 

## Distributed Loads

You can substitute a distributed load, which may or may not be uniform, with a point load:

The magnitude of the resultant force is:

$$ R =\int w \ dx  $$

And the $\bar x$ coordinate is:

$$ \bar x = \frac{\int x w\ dx}{R} $$

There are some shortcuts you can take too for primitive shapes:

## Internal Effects

Beams also account for **axial** ($P$), **shear** ($V$), **torsional** ($T$) and **bending** ($M$) forces. These are all *internal forces*, so they must be developed in order to maintain equilibrium with any external force (for statics at least).

You can use the basic equations of equilibrium to find these values at any slice of a beam.

#### Mathematical Relationship
All of these values are related mathematically:

If we sum forces *in the y-axis*:

$$ \sum F_y = V-(w\ dx)-(V+dV) = 0 $$

You can solve this to get:

$$w = -\frac{dV}{dx} $$

Now, if you were to plot shear over $x$, you would know that its slope must be equal to the loading. This also means that you can integrate to solve for the shear force:

$$\int \limits_{V_0}^V dV=-\int\limits_{x_0}^xw\ dx$$

where $V_0$ is the shear force at $x_0$, which is required to evaluate the definite integral.

Next, if we *sum the moments* about a point on the element:

$$\sum M=M+(w\ dx)\left(\frac{dx}{2}\right)+(V+dV)(dx)-(M+dM)=0$$

Simplifying yields:

$$ V = \frac{dM}{dx} $$

If you were to plot the moment over $x$, you would know that its slope would be equal to the shear for each point. And, because $V$ is expressed in terms of the load, we can also say:

$$ \frac{d^2M}{dx^2}=-w$$

Again, you can also integrate to evaluate $M$:

$$ \int \limits _{M_0}^M dM = \int \limits_{x_0}^xV\ dx$$

where $M_0$ is the bending moment at $x_0$.

### Tricks

God, I'm literally citing ChatGPT, but it looks like for a point load, the change in shear is equal to the magnitude of that point load.

For instance,

The corresponding shear-moment diagram is:

![|346](../../media/Pasted%20image%2020241115105734.webp)

Notice that, as we cross the point load, the shear drops by exactly $4\ kN$, which is exactly the magnitude of that point load.
