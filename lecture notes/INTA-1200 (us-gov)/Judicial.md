Judicial Branch (II)
- Judicial Review
	- Checks if matters are consistent with the Constitution.
	- It was intended from the very startâ€”intentional.
- Supreme Court
	- Nine active members, but not fixed in the Constitution.
	- New cases refer to previous rulings; they try to make their decisions predictable.
	- They are reluctant to decide on natural rights that haven't been determined before.
	- They should not have any political reasoning when making decisions. Their sole goal is to determine whether or not the Constitution supports something.
	- The President appoints justices, but the Senate has to approve.
- You could pack the court by...
	- 1) Expanding the number of seats.
	- 2) Making appointments if someone leaves.
- You could impeach a member, or pull the budget from the Supreme Court.
	- Congress can also prevent the Supreme Court from hearing certain cases.
