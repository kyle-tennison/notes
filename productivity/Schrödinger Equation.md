# Schrödinger Equation

## Derivation

#### Classical Significance

Newton's second law tells us:

$$\textbf F = m  \frac{d^2 \textbf r}{dt^2}$$

If we express $\textbf F$ as a derivative of potential energy, we can say:

$$ - \nabla W_{pot} = m \frac{d^2 \textbf r}{dt^2}$$

where $W_{pot}$ is the potential energy function.

> I should go find an example of how force can be expressed like this. I can't think of how force gives rise to a potential energy function like this—it seems to violate the idea that the derivative of work is inexact.

Because of the particle-wave duality, this classical approach will not work for quantum particles. [Heisenberg's uncertainty principle](../independent%20study/quantum/Quantum%20Notes.md#Position%20and%20Momentum%20Operators) forbids the measurement of a particle's position with infinite accuracy. For this reason, the Schrödinger Equation treats electrons as mass waves.
