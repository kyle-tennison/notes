# 3.5 AC/DC Conversion

### 3.5.1 Half Wave Rectifier

Literally just a diode

### 3.5.2 Full Wave Rectifiers

Weird way to draw it

Ideally, $V_{out} = |V_{in}|$ 

However, due to forward voltage drops, the magnitude is reduced, and there are periods of zero voltage:

The voltage drop will be **twice** the forward voltage drop of the diodes. To do this calculation, you need the peak-to-peak voltage; the RMS relationship is different. 

### 3.5.4 AC to DC Conversion

Passing the rectified voltage from a full wave rectifier to a low-pass filter will output DC voltage.

Realistically, all you're doing is adding a capacitor.

Depending on the value of $\tau$, where $\tau=RC$, you can adjust the smoothing ability. The larger $\tau$ is, the slower the circuit will be to discharge and hence the smoothing will be better.
