# Dislocations

Plastic deformation requires bond breaking and movement. At the atomic level, these are always from *shear stresses* (not normal stresses).

Tensile loads can obviously still cause deformation, but they cause a type of shear deformation:

The *ideal yield strength* is found from the force required to break all the bonds in a plane. However, this ideal strength does not match the measured yield strength (off by orders of magnitude).

In reality, there is *dislocation motion (glide)*. You need to break a *line of bonds*, not an entire plane of bonds. The true yield strength is much lower.

An *edge dislocation* defect lowers the energy required to shift the atoms. The dislocation "glides" down the lattice. We call this a *dislocation glide*.

Impeding this dislocation motion tends to increase yield strength; enhancing it tends to increase ductility.

These dislocations occur along the path of least resistance. This is usually the shortest "hop" between bonds.

#### Slip Planes

Crystalline planes with the highest atomic packing density (atoms per unit area).

If you're asked to find which plane (given Miller indices) has the highest atomic packing density, count the number of atoms that intersect that plane.

#### Slip Directions

Crystalline directions with the highest linear packing density (atoms per unit length).

### Slip Systems

Slip Systems = Slip Planes + Slip Directions

Notation is `{family of planes}<family of directions>`

The greater the number of *unique* slip systems in a material, the easier it is to plastically deform (generally).

To be a **unique** slip system, *slip planes cannot be parallel to each other, and slip directions cannot be collinear.*

> BCC breaks the ductility to slip system relationship because it's not a close-packed system

## Strengthening Mechanisms

By adding solute atoms, large particles, or other types of defects, it can make it more difficult for dislocation motion to occur. You effectively put obstacles in the path.

The bond type and atomic packing density will influence how much the material is strengthened. 

#### Solid Solution Hardening
*Solid solution hardening* adds solute atoms into the lattice. The yield strength is related to the concentration of the impurity by: 

$$ \sigma _y \propto \sqrt {c}$$

where $c$ is the concentration percent and $\sigma_y$ is the yield strength.

#### Precipitation Hardening
*Precipitation hardening* adds a large precipitate particle. This strengthens in two ways:
- Cuts through dislocation slices
- Increases the path of least resistance required to glide.

#### Work Hardening

After a material reaches its yield strength and is unloaded, its yield strength will increase because it has been **work hardened.**

This is the same effect as cold rolling a material. You are inducing dislocations.

- Internal stresses are formed
- Grains are deformed
- Dislocations are added
- Decreases ductility but increases yield strength.

**Hot working**:
- Above the recrystallization temperature
- Doesn't influence internal stresses or grain structure  
> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - Hot working does, in fact, influence the grain structure through processes such as dynamic recrystallization. It can also alter internal stresses, so it is incorrect to state that it does not affect the grain structure or stresses.
- No dislocations are added  
> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - Some dislocations will still be created during hot working, though they may be rearranged or removed through dynamic recovery and recrystallization. It is not completely correct to say that none are added.
- Keeps lower yield point and higher ductility

#### Grain Boundary Hardening (Hall-Petch strengthening)

You can decrease grain size by adding nucleating agents. The *smaller your grains, the higher shear strength.* The physical process for achieving this is rather complicated, but the general trend towards increased strength for smaller grains is all that's important for this class.

$$\tau_{GB} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}$$

where:
- $\tau_{GB}$ is the strength from grain boundaries
- $D$ is the grain size

### Burgers Vectors

Shows how a dislocation slip changes the crystal.

To find the Burgers vector,
1. Count the number of atoms in the grid on the top, then on the right, then on the bottom, then on the left. Basically, just find the shape of the lattice sample.
2. If you end up where you started, there is no Burgers vector, but if you finish at another point, the Burgers vector points between your finish and your start.

You have to take *the same number of steps* in either parallel direction (3 and 4 in the example above).

## Total Yield Strength

$$ \tau _y  = \tau_{lattice} + \tau _{ss} + \tau_{ppt} + \tau_{d} + \tau_{gb}$$

- $\tau_{ss}$ is from solid solution
- $\tau_{ppt}$ is from precipitate
- $\tau_{d}$ is from dislocations
- $\tau_{gb}$ is from grain boundaries
- $\tau_{lattice}$ is from the lattice itself and cannot be changed
