# 3.3 Active Filters


## 3.3.1 First-Order [Lowpass Filter](2.2%20Frequency%20Response.md#Lowpass%20Filter%20Properties)

A first order filter has the transfer function of:

$$H(\omega) = K_{DC} \frac{1}{\tau j \omega + 1}$$

 $\omega_b$ is the bandwidth, which is $\omega _b =  \tau ^{-1}$ and the DC Gain is $H(0)=K_{DC}$. 

To convert a passive lowpass filter into an active lowpass filter, you can add a [Buffer Circuit](3.2%20Op%20Amps.md#3.2.2%20Buffer%20Circuits) to either the input or the output. 

Alternatively, you can move the op amp into the feedback loop of the filter, isolating both the input and the output:

The output of this filter is given by the following:

$$V_o= -\frac{R_f}{R_1}\cdot \frac{1}{R_fCj\omega +1} V_{in}$$

The DC gain of this filter is $K_{DC}=-\frac{R_f}{R_1}$ , the bandwidth is $\omega _b = \frac{1}{R_fC_f}$, and the transfer function is:

$$H(\omega) = -\frac{R_f}{R_1}\frac{1}{(R_fCj\omega + 1)}$$
$$|H(\omega)| = \frac{R_f}{R_1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{(R_fC_f\omega)^2+1}}$$
$$\angle H(\omega) = 180 - \text{arctan}(R_fC_f\omega )$$

For reference, the [Bode Plot Conversion](2.2%20Frequency%20Response.md#^bode-plot-conversion) for decibel scales is here.

### 3.3.2 First-Order [Highpass Filters](2.2%20Frequency%20Response.md)

$$H(\omega ) = \frac{Kj \omega}{\tau j \omega + 1}$$

The corner frequency $\omega_c = 1 / \tau$ and the passband gain is $K_{PB}=K/ \tau$. 

An inverting highpass filter is shown below:

The equation for the output voltage is:

$$V_o = \frac{-R_fCj\omega}{(R_1Cj\omega +1)}V_{in}$$

Here, the corner frequency is $\omega_c =\frac{1}{R_1C}$. 

The transfer function is:

$$H(\omega) = \frac{-R_fCj\omega}{R_1CJ\omega +1}$$
$$|H(\omega)| = \frac{R_fC\omega}{\sqrt{(R_1C\omega)^2+1}}$$
$$\angle H(\omega) = -90 ^{\circ}- \text{arctan}(R_1C\omega)$$


The passband gain, as $\omega \to \infty$ is $-R_f/R_1$. 

> Remember, Hz needs to be converted to rad/s

### 3.3.3 Cascaded First Order Circuits

The transfer functions in terms of frequency instead of $\omega$ 

For a lowpass filter, this is:

$$H(f)=K_{DC}\frac{1}{\frac{jf}{f_0}+1}$$
where $\omega_b = \omega _0 = 2 \pi f_0$ 

For a highpass filter:

$$H(f)= K_{PB} \frac{\frac{jf}{f_0}}{(\frac{jf}{f_0}+1)}$$

where $\omega _c = \omega _0  = 2 \pi f_0$ 

**Cascading filters** applies the output of one filter as the input to a new filter. The transfer of the cascaded filter is the product of the constituent filters:

$$H_c(\omega) = \prod_i H_i(\omega)$$
You will often get [Bandpass and Notch Filters](2.2%20Frequency%20Response.md#2.2.11%20Bandpass%20and%20Notch%20Filters) from doing this.

When combining a lowpass and highpass filter with a corner frequency of $f_l$ and $f_h$ respectively, the resultant ideal bandpass will have the properties of:

$$f_0 = \sqrt{f_lf_h}$$
$$Q= \frac{\sqrt{f_lf_h}}{f_l+f_h}$$

$$\text{BW} = f_l+f_h$$

The maximum quality is $Q=1/2$, which occurs when the lowpass and highpass filters have the same corner frequency.
