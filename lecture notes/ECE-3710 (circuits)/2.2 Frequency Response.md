# 2.2 Frequency Response


## 2.2.2 Frequency Spectrum

A *Frequency Spectrum* plots the amplitude of a function over frequency.

If a signal can be broken into constituent sine waves, you can simply sum the frequency spectra for each constituent wave to get the total frequency spectrum.

This lets you see which frequencies are dominant.

## 2.2.3 Frequency Spectra of Real Signals

Often, a *decibel* scale is used in the frequency spectrum.

Harmonics are integer multiples of a base frequency.

## 2.2.4 Linear Frequency Response

If you have a transfer function $H(\omega)$, you can plot $|H|$ vs $\omega$ to get a frequency spectrum. You can do the same for $\angle H(\omega)$ vs $\omega$.

If you have a DC component, you should transform it by $H(0)$.

## 2.2.5 Bode Plot

The Bode plot is the plot of the transfer function on a logarithmic scale.

A *decade* is the difference between a frequency and 10x that frequency.

The decibel value is $|H(\omega)|_{dB} = 20 \log_{10}(|H(\omega)|)$. Or, the other way, $|H(\omega)| = 10^{|H(\omega)|_{dB}/20}$. ^bode-plot-conversion

If you have an input such as:

$$v_{in}(t)=1+\cos(100t-45 \degree)+\cos(3000t)$$

you can break apart each partition, apply the transfer function, and sum everything back up. The amplitudes and phase angles will change, but the frequency will remain constant.

> You might have to convert between $Hz$ and $\omega$.

## 2.2.6 Bode Plot of RC Circuits

The *Corner Frequency* $\omega_c$ is the theoretical point where these two lines meet:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250305150836.png)

For an RC circuit, the corner frequency is found with:

$$\omega_c = \frac{1}{RC} \text{rad/sec}$$

In general, these circuits are characterized by a low frequency region and a high frequency region. These regions are often generalized by their slope in $dB/decade$.

The orientation of the RC circuit also determines how the circuit behaves.

## 2.2.7 Bode Plot of RLC Circuits

The corner frequency for an RLC circuit is:

$$\omega_c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$

Depending on whether the circuit is over/underdamped, the Bode plot will change:

Notice that both of these would be Lowpass filters (see below).

## 2.2.8 Lowpass and Highpass Filters

These are *analog filters* that filter out certain frequencies.

A **Lowpass Filter** passes low frequencies through and *attenuates high frequencies*.

A **Highpass Filter** passes high frequencies through and *attenuates low frequencies*.

If you have a frequency plot with discrete points, you can multiply each value by the Bode plot to get the output frequency response.

#### Lowpass Filter Properties

The **bandwidth** $\omega_B$ is the distance across the **passband region**, which is defined by the region where the magnitude $K_{DC} > 0.707K_{DC}$.

![|326](Pasted%20image%2020250305152946.png)

The **Passband Gain** $G$ is the magnitude at $\omega=0$, or in other words, $G=K_{DC}=|H(0)|$. On a Bode plot, a 3 dB drop corresponds to the 0.707 drop, which will give where $\omega_B$ is defined.

#### Highpass Filter Properties

The passband, corner frequency, etc., all apply in the same way, except on the right-hand side of the plot.

## 2.2.9 Lowpass and Highpass Filter Design

For a lowpass RC filter, $\omega_B = \omega_c$ and $G_{dB}=0\ dB$. 

For a highpass RC filter, $G_{dB}=0\ dB$ and $\omega_c = \frac{1}{RC}$.

So, if you want to design a filter that, for example, attenuates frequencies *above* 200 Hz, we:

1. Convert from Hz to $\omega$
   1. $\omega_B=200\left(\frac{\cancel{rot}}{s}\right)\left(\frac{2\pi \text{ rad}}{\cancel{rot}}\right)=1256\,\frac{\text{rad}}{s}$
2. Pick a value for R or C, then solve for the other using: 
   $$\omega_B=\omega_c = \frac{1}{RC}$$
   1. For this instance, if $C=1 \mu F$, then $R = \frac{1}{\omega_B C}=796\,\Omega$.

For RLC circuits, there is no easy equation for $\omega_B$.

## 2.2.11 Bandpass and Notch Filters

A **bandpass filter** will pass frequencies that occur within a certain band, and a **notch filter** will attenuate frequencies that occur in a certain region.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250305161507.png)

> A notch filter is sometimes called a band-stop filter.

The passband is again defined as the points where $G_{dB}\ge 3\ dB$. A notch filter uses a **stop band** which is $G_{dB} < 3\ dB$.

> ü§ñ (notecheck comment) - Typically, the ‚Äú3 dB point‚Äù refers to a drop of 3 dB from the peak gain. Defining the passband as G(dB) ‚â• 3 dB (instead of G(dB) ‚â• -3 dB from the peak) is non-standard and may cause confusion.

The *center frequency* of a filter, which is the center of the peak/trough in the notch and bandpass filters, in an RLC circuit is:

$$\omega_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$

The *width of the passband* for the bandpass filter (again, assuming RLC) is $R/L$.

The **quality** of a bandpass filter is given as:

$$Q = \frac{f_0}{\text{BW}}$$

where $\text{BW}$ is the bandwidth, $\text{BW} = f_u - f_l$, and $f_0$ is the corner frequency. You can swap between Hz and rad/s for this.
