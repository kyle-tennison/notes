# 2. Decision Making Process

## The Nine Step Decision Making Process

1. Recognize the problem
	- This could be an issue or an opportunity that has not yet been addressed.
2. Define the goal or objective
	- A goal is a general statement; an objective is narrow (in this class).
3. Assemble relevant data
	- Look for published or internal information.
	- Know what is irrelevant and what should be disregarded.
4. Identify feasible ideas
	- Brainstorm many feasible ideas.
	- Can the problem be ignored?
5. Generate criteria to test the ideas
	- Use these criteria to pick the "best" idea.
6. Construct the models
	- Merge the previous steps into a model that represents the most important parts of the system.
	- This can look different for different applications.
7. Predict the output for each model
	- Use cost/benefit analyses to weigh the different models against a criterion.
8. Select the best idea
	- Consider both economic and non-economic criteria.
	- Try using the process of elimination.
9. Audit the results
	- Compare results to the predicted behavior.
