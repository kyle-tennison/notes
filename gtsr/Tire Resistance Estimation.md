## Problem

We need to know how much power is lost at nominal velocity due to tire friction with the ground. Modeling this value can allow us to evaluate whether a component is advantageous to the overall efficiency of the car or if its mass outweighs its benefit.

As the tires are compressed, they deform more and, in turn, dissipate more energy as heat. Therefore, a relationship exists between the weight on the tires and the dissipated energy.
$$\dot Q_f(V, m)$$
Where
- $\dot Q_f$ is the power lost to friction from heat
- $V$ is velocity
- $m$ is the mass of the vehicle

We assume that the tire temperature and its pressure remain constant over the duration of the trip.

### Estimations

Based solely on intuition, I expect the result to show that, roughly, $\dot Q_f \propto V$ and that $\dot Q_f \propto m^k$ where $k>1$, meaning that the power loss is exponential to mass. Again, these values are solely inferences based on no actual experimental results.

> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - Typically, for standard rolling friction, the lost power is linearly proportional to both velocity and mass. The assumption that power loss is exponentially related to mass (k>1) is not supported by common rolling friction theory.

## Theory

A tire generates heat in two primary ways:
1) Hysteretic heat generation
2) Surface heat generation

##### Hysteretic heat generation

This heat generation is due to the elastic nature of a viscoelastic material, where some heat is lost due to the strain of the material. 

##### Surface Heat generation

Surface heat generation is caused by slip with the road. With large slip angles, this becomes significant; however, this effect is likely negligible.
