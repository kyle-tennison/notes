# Conservation Laws

As discussed in [Summing Lagrangians](Lagrange's%20Equations.md#Summing%20Lagrangians), there are $2s$ arbitrary constants that result from solving the [Euler-Lagrange equation](Calculus%20of%20Variations.md#^euler-lagrange) (where $s$ is the number of degrees of freedom). As discussed in [Galileo's Relativity Principle](Galileo's%20Relativity%20Principle.md), in an



$$\frac{dL}{dt}=\sum _i\dot q_i \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q_i})+\sum_i \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q _i}\ddot q_i$$

$$\frac{dL}{dt}=\sum_i\frac{d}{dt}(\dot q_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q_i})$$
