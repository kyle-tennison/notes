# 8. Present Worth Analysis

The relationship between the following *situations* and *criteria* is:

| Situation     | Criterion           | Example              |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Fixed Input   | Maximize Output     | $150k Budget$        |
| Fixed Output  | Maximize Input      | 20k $ft^2$ available |
| Neither Fixed | Maximize Difference | Both Variable        |

> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - For a "Fixed Output" scenario, the usual criterion is to "Minimize Input," not "Maximize Input."

When analyzing the present worth, consider the *useful life* of the alternative. Knowing this, there are three options for the analysis period:
1. The analysis period *is* the useful life.
2. The analysis period is different from the useful life.
3. The analysis period is infinite, $n=\infty$. 

> Ignoring that 3 is a subset of 2. Whatever

### Example 1

*Two devices are being considered. Both cost \$10,000 now, have useful lives of 5 years, and have no salvage value. Device A will result in \$300 savings per year for each of the next 5 years. Device B will result in \$400 savings in the 1st year and reduce by \$50 each year. If the interest rate is 7%, which device should you choose?*

Because both cost \$10,000 now, the input is fixed, and the goal is therefore to *maximize the output.* We also know that the **planning horizon** is 5 years because the useful lives of both devices are 5 years.

> What is the planning horizon? Is this the analysis period?

The cash flow diagrams for the two options are:

For device A, we want to find $P_A$ given A ($P=A(P/A, i, n)$):

$$P_A=\$300(P/A, 7\%, 5)=\$300\cdot(4.100)=\$1230$$

For device B, we need to convert the cash flow diagram into something we can process:

We can now find $P_B$ with a uniform series and an arithmetic gradient.

$$P_B =A(P/A, i,n)-G(P/G, i, n)$$
$$P_B =\$400(P/A, 7\%,5)-\$50(P/G, 7\%, 5)=\$400(4.100)-\$50(7.647)=\$1257.65$$

Now, because $P_B>P_A$, Device B is the best choice.

### Useful Lives Different from the Analysis Period

If the useful lives of alternatives are non-constant, the analysis period will typically be the least common multiple of the two useful lives. In this scenario, *assume you purchase an identical item at the end of the first item's useful life.*

The NPW (net present worth) is calculated for an instance like this using the following cash flow diagram.

In this example, the useful life is 5 years. Notice that:
- Salvage occurs at $t=5$.
- The new product is purchased at $t=5$.
- The uniform value is not interrupted by salvage/purchase.

### Infinite Analysis Period

**Capitalized cost** is the amount of *present money* needed that can sustain a project (at some interest rate) forever.

The value you need to deposit at $t=0$ to sustain some future cost for $t\to \infty$ is:

$$P= \frac{A}{i}$$

> $i$ may need to be an [Effective Interest Rate](7.%20Complicating%20Factors.md#Effective%20Interest%20Rates)

This assumes that the first payment occurs at $t=1$. 

## Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR)

$$\text{BCR}=\frac{\sum\text{PV of benefits}}{\sum \text{PV of costs}}$$
