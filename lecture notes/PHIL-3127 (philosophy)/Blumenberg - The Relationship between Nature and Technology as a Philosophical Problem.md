# Blumenberg - The Relationship between Nature and Technology as a Philosophical Problem

- Written in the post-war era.
- Written just after the Turing Test.
- Theory has more "being" than its real form.
- Skill/technology can exist without theory 
	- Technology is performative; it doesn't need to be based on some truth.
	- He questions why we feel the need to develop technology.
	- Isolation and abstraction are a big part of modern science, but the idea that you can abstract and isolate is not definite; one can argue that there is no such way to isolate something.
		- Mathematical equations are a way that we abstract away from the physical world.
- He says that we have to "think through our tools"; our physical bodies are not well equipped for anything without tools.
	- This may be our drive to create technology.
	- He says that man is a technical animal.
	- He says that tools are "trapping us"; they aren't simply extensions of us but, in some regard, they are autonomous and we yield to them.
- We have become so acquainted with modern technology that we become unfamiliar with nature itself. We differentiate between the inside world and the outside world.
	- We have created a new kind, which is why he argues that there is autonomy.
	- There is a significant shift between the medieval world and now in thought on this topic.
- In many ways, everything has become strictly utilitarian and as cheap as possible. You can see this in children's toys.
- Talks about the Christian side of things; we aren't *from* nature, we're placed *into* nature; he sees humans as part-divine. 
	- He thinks that there's a need to create a world for ourselvesâ€”nature itself is not welcoming to us.
	- He thinks that Christianity paved the way for technization.
- The infinite was only seen as a good thing in the medieval period after it was associated with the divine.
- The relationship and picture of God was shaped by technology; nowadays there is no physical interaction with God, he is completely transcended and the relationship is mostly hidden. 
	- It used to be common to think that individual skill was bestowed upon an individual by a god. This contrasts with the contemporary practice of being "great" as an individual. The Greeks would've seen this as arrogant.
	- Self-asserting individuals.
- Argues that there really is invention and not simply copies of nature. Argues that creative genius is real. 
	- As creators, we don't depend on Christ to create.
	- This leads to the idea that God is dead.
- Suggests that myth serves to reconcile the fear and unpredictability of nature by framing it in anthropomorphic or divine terms.
