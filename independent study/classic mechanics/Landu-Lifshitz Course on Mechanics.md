# Landau-Lifshitz Course on Mechanics

A free copy of the book can be [found here](https://ia903206.us.archive.org/4/items/landau-and-lifshitz-physics-textbooks-series/Vol%201%20-%20Landau%2C%20Lifshitz%20-%20Mechanics%20%283rd%20ed%2C%201976%29.pdf).

This is the first volume of three courses on physics. There is the *Classical Theory of Fields* (vol. 2) and *Quantum Mechanics* (vol. 3) to go.

1. The Equations of Motion
	1. [Lagrange's Equations](Lagrange's%20Equations.md)
	2. [Galileo's Relativity Principle](Galileo's%20Relativity%20Principle.md)
	3.

> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - The statement that this is "the first volume of three courses on physics" is inaccurate. The Landau-Lifshitz "Course of Theoretical Physics" is a 10-volume series, not just 3 volumes.
