# Why I Want to be a Posthuman When I Grow Up


Argues that eventually we would have the ability 5to be posthumans

Says that a posthuman healthspan would be better, which would benefit people. He backs this up with our natrual desire to live longer. He talks about lifespan and old age too.

He also talks about how cognition can be improved, which would also be supproted by contemporary humans.

He mentions how emotions can be improved: suicidal depression could be fixed by neurochemical balances.  We would also grow less prejudiced and unconstructive.

Argues that it's part of human exploration. We should continue to explore possibilities.

Personal identity can remain constant when becoming posthuman, because memories and thoughts remain constant.
