# Structure of Polymers

Polymers are chains of repeat units called **monomers**. This is the polymer's SRO.

There are a few types of polymers:
- **Homopolymers** repeat the same unit.
- **Copolymers** have different repeat units.
	- **Block copolymers** have alternating "blocks" of two units.
	- **Statistical copolymers** have random switching between two units.

### Side Groups

Side groups hang off the polymer backbone:

### Polymer Structure

#### Tacticity

Tacticity describes the arrangement of the side groups in a polymer.

Some types are:
- **Atactic**
	- randomly arranged
	- non-dense packing
	- hard to crystallize
- **Isotactic**
	- arranged on the same side
- **Syndiotactic**
	- alternating; every other monomer

#### Architecture

A grafted architecture has two polymers; the main chain is one type and the "branches" are another type. This is different from comb or branched architectures, where all the polymers are the same.

#### Molecular Weight

The molecular weight of a polymer depends on its structureâ€”not just the stoichiometry.

> This quantifies the weight/mass per mole of polymer strands. Because there are so many molecules in each **macromolecule** polymer strand, these weights are huge. For instance, polystyrene can have a molecular weight of 100,000â€“400,000 g/mol ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene#Production)).

You can calculate the **number average** molecular weight, which is the *average number of monomers per chain times the monomer weight*.

$$ M_n = \frac{\sum M_iN_i}{\sum N_i}$$

You can also calculate the **weight average** molecular weight, which accounts for the fact that larger elements make up more weight of the polymer sample:

$$M_w = \frac{\sum M_i^2N_i}{\sum M_iN_i}$$

A higher molecular weight will usually correspond to:
- higher elastic modulus
- higher toughness
- higher service temperature
- higher tensile strength
- higher chemical resistance
- lower glass transition temperature (???)

> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - The statement that higher molecular weight usually corresponds to a lower glass transition temperature is incorrect. In most cases, a higher molecular weight leads to a higher or similar Tg, not lower.

The inverse is true for lower molecular weights.

**Side groups** may influence the molecular weight of an object, in turn influencing the properties listed above.

### Cross Linking

**Chemical cross links** entail *covalent bonds* between two polymer chains. An example of this is natural rubber.

**Physical cross links** entail ionic/hydrogen bonds between polymer chains. An example of this is synthetic rubber.

Cross links increase the strength and rigidity of the material.

## Time Dependency

Some properties of polymers, such as their stress-strain curve, are dependent on time.

**Viscoelasticity** refers to how a polymer's elasticity is somewhat liquid-like.

The **Deborah number** quantifies the "time scale of deformation." The *lower* the Deborah number is, the *faster* a material will change. (????)

> Doesn't make much sense so far.

$$ De = \frac{time\ of\ relaxation}{time\ of\ observation}$$

**Creep** quantifies how, with a constant stress applied, strain may change with time:

**Stress relaxation** quantifies how stress will decrease with time after a strain is applied:

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](../../media/excalidraw/excalidraw-2024-11-10-17.04.04.excalidraw.md)%%

^ This differs from an elastic material, which has constant stress to maintain strain. Think of a rubber band vs. silly putty; the rubber band will continue tugging, but the silly putty won't.

#### Glass Transition in Polymers

A polymer will be rubbery until it is below its glass transition temperature, where it becomes glassy.

Below the glass transition temperature, everything becomes glassy.

## Thermosets vs Thermoplastics

Thermosets have a **high degree of crosslinking**. This causes thermosets to be tough but brittle.

Thermoplastics have less crosslinking, which allows them to be melted and remelted. Thermosets degrade under high temperatures before melting.

Thermoplastics can be recycled, whereas thermosets cannot (at least for now).

#### Flame Polishing

Thermoplastics can be melted and reformed; they can be flame polished to clean up their surface.

This image shows acrylic being flame polished to remove the rough edge, making it appear more transparent.

This process is mainly aesthetic, but it can end up hardening or softening the surface of the material, depending on the thermoset being used.
