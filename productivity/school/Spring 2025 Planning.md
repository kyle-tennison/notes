# Spring 2025 Planning
--- 

The **Cañada ENGR 210** (which *corresponds to ME 1670*) class really throws a wrench in my schedule. The transfer evaluation department moves very slowly, so I will only know if *I can take ME 2110 when ME 1670 transfers*—if it does at all. So, to cover my tracks, I'm going to come up with two schedules

## If ENGR-210 *successfully* transfers

#### Spring 2025

| Class Name                            | Credits |
|:------------------------------------- | ------- |
| ME 2110 (Creative Decisions & Design) | 3       |
| ME 2202 (Dynamics)                    | 3       |
| ECE 3710 (Circuits & Electronics)     | 2       |
| ISYE 3025 (Engineering Economics)     | 1       |
| APPH 1040/1050/1060 (Wellness)          | 2       |
| Art Elective                          | 3       |
| **Total**                             | **14**  |


## If ENGR-210 *does not* transfer

#### Spring 2025

| Class Name                                     | Credits |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| APPH 1040/1050/1060 (Wellness)                   | 2       |
| ME 2202 (Rigid Body Dynamics)                  | 3       |
| ECE 3710 (Circuits & Electronics) *could drop* | 2       |
| ME 2016 (Computing Techniques)                 | 3       |
| ME 3340 (Fluids)                               | 3       |
| ME 1670 (Engineering Graphics & Design)        | 3       |
| **Total**                                      | **16**  |
