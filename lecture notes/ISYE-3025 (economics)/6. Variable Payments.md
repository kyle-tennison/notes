# 6. Variable Payments

## Constant Uniform Payment

A uniform payment is a function of the following:
- $P$, the principle (aka present) value
- $A$, the amount per uniform payment
- $i$, the interest rate
- $n$, the number of periods

> The interest rate $i$ must be normalized to the number of periods. For instance, if each period is 1 month, then the interest rate $i$ needs to be the monthly interest rate. You can divide an annual interest rate by 12 to get the monthly rate, and so forth.


To do this, you can:
1. use the excel functions discussed in [[5. Single Payment]], only now provide a payment parameter
2. Use the equation
	$$P=A\begin{bmatrix}  \frac{{(1+i)^n-1}}{{i(1+i)^n}} \end{bmatrix}$$
3. Reference the tables under

If you're trying to solve for a payment $A$, you can again use the table, or use the `pmt` function in excel, which takes the present value, # of periods, and interest rate per period.

If you're trying to solve for interest, you can make a cash flow table. *The red signifies a negative value here.* This shows a negative payment (getting the loan), then slowly paying it back. Use the `irr` function to get the monthly interest rate using the flow column, then multiply by 12 to get the yearly interest rate.

## Uniform Gradient Payment

A **Uniform Gradient Payment** is a payment method where:
1. The first payment is $0
2. The payment increases over time. The difference between $P_i-P_{i-1}=G$

The equation for this type of flow is:

$$P=G\bigg [ \frac{(1+i)^n - ni -1}{i^2(1+i)^n} \bigg ]$$
The notation used in this class is $P_G = G(P/G, i, n)$. 

You can get this in the tables:

And unfortunately, there are no excel functions for this.

You can solve for G with something like:

> When calculating this, $n$ is the total number of periods to pay of $P$. 



You can calculate an **equivalent uniform series** factor $A$. Also shown in the table.

## Geometric Series

Geometric series have payments increase exponentially at rate $g$. There's no table to calculate this.

$A_1$ is the first payment, $g$ is the payment rate, $i$ is the interest rate.

You can also use the future value version:

$$\text{FV} = A_1 \left( \frac{(1 + i)^n - (1 + g)^n}{i - g} \right)$$
