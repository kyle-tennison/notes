# Divergence Theorem

*The following is written by AI and modified by Kyle Tennison*

The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) relates the flux of a vector field $\textbf{F}$ across a closed surface $\textbf{S}$ to the volume integral of the divergence of $\textbf{F}$ over the volume $\textbf{V}$ enclosed by $\textbf{S}$:

$$
\iint_{S} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \iiint_{V} (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV
$$

## Derivation

Let **F** be a continuously differentiable vector field defined on a closed, bounded volume **V** with a piecewise smooth boundary surface **S**, oriented outward.

1. **Start from the divergence definition:**

   $$
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \lim_{V \to 0} \frac{1}{V} \oint_{\partial V} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
   $$

   This describes the average flux density exiting an infinitesimal volume.

2. **Apply the integral form over finite volume:**

   Divide **V** into infinitesimal volume elements \( \delta V_i \). The total flux through **S** is the sum of the fluxes through the boundary of each \( \delta V_i \). Internal surface contributions cancel due to opposite orientations. Only the boundary surfaces contribute:

   $$
   \sum \iint_{\partial (\delta V_i)} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS \to \iint_{S} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S}
   $$

3. **Transition to volume integral:**

   By summing over all $\Delta V_i$, and taking the limit as $\Delta V_i \to 0$ :

   $$
   \iiint_{V} (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV = \iint_{S} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S}
   $$

   Thus, proven.
