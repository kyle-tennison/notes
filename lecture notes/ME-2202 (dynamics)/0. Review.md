- Unit vectors will have a $\hat \quad$ (hat)
- For frame $A$, you will often see the coordinate system ($\mathbb R^2$) denoted as $\hat i _A$ and $\hat j _A$, or, if in $\mathbb R^3$, it will also have $\hat k _A$. 


The time derivative of a vector $\vec v$ is :

$$\dot {\vec v}=\frac{d\vec v }{dt} = \left [ \frac{dv_1}{d_t}, \frac{dv_2}{dt}, \dots \right ]$$

HW Notes

Problem 5?
![[IMG_0244.jpeg]]

The relationship between $l, x, \& y$ is:

$$x^2 + y^2 = l^2$$

However, $x$ and $y$ are functions of $t$, so:

$$x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = l^2$$

Taking the derivative of this gives:

$$2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$$

Then, taking the second derivative gives:

$$(\dot x \cdot \dot x + x \cdot \ddot x)+ (\dot y \cdot \dot y + y \cdot \ddot y) =0$$

From the problem, we are told that the speed $v_0$ is constant, meaning $\ddot x=0, \dot x = v_0 \text{(const)}$.
