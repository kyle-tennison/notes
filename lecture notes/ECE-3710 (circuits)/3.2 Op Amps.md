# 3.2 Op Amps

## 3.2.1 Introduction to Op Amps and Ideal Behavior

An **Operational Amplifier** (Op Amp) is made of transistors, resistors, etc. It is an IC. They allow you to boost power and voltage.

The $V_S$ terminals power the IC; the remaining pins are inputs and outputs. Usually, these power supply pins are neglected in circuit diagrams.

Op Amps are often used in **active filters**; an *active* element is one that depends on a power supply.

The output voltage is given by:

$$v_o = A(v_+ - v_-)$$

However, there is a maximum $v_o$ called the **saturation** voltage, which will (often) be the voltage of the supply. The value $A$ is the *open loop gain*, which changes based on the device.

If $A$ is very large, $v_o$ will reach saturation very quickly. In this case, we can simplify an Op Amp's output voltage to be:

$$v_o=\begin{cases}V_s &\text{if } v_{in}>0\\ -V_s &\text{if } v_{in}<0 \end{cases}$$

where $v_{in} = v_+ - v_-$. 

In this case, the output of any input will be pushed to either saturation value depending on the sign:
