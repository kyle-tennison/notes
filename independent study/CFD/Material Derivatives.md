# Material Derivatives

Material derivatives are a continuum mechanics concept that describes the *rate of change* of some physical quantity of a **[Material Element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_parcel)** (i.e., an infinitesimal volumeâ€”aka a **Fluid Parcel**) that are within a velocity field that depends on space and time. 

Other names for the material derivative include:

- advective derivative
- convective derivative
- derivative following the motion
- hydrodynamic derivative
- Lagrangian derivative
- particle derivative
- substantial derivative
- substantive derivative
- Stokes derivative
- total derivative

For a macroscopic tensor field $y(\textbf{x}, t)$, the Material Derivative is defined as:

$$\frac{Dy}{Dt} \equiv \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} +\textbf{u}\cdot \nabla y$$

where $\nabla y$ is the *[covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative)* of the tensor and $\textbf{u}(\textbf{x}, t)$ is the flow velocity. The $\textbf{u}\cdot \nabla y$ term can be thought of the directional derivative in the $\textbf{u}$ direction: $(\textbf{u}\cdot \nabla)y$.
