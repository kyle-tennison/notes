# Moore's Law for Everything

> Even more power will shift from labor to capital.

If humans aren't aren't needed to work, there will be no flow of money to labor sectors; instead, it will shit towards capital in large entities. It's easy to see how this would harm the middle and lower class signifigantly.

Altman extrapolates the success we have had in prior years into the future. However, Moore's law, at least for semiconductors, has stagnated in recent years. It's important to notice that exponential extrapolation can easily be misleading.

If I make an instagram post that goes viral, and my follower count doubles every day for the first week, you can't extrapolate that to infinity.

From 1900 to 1970, we went from wagons to the moon—literally. People living in the 1970s extrapolated, and it only made sense that in 10 years we'd have flying cars and people on mars.

Altman points out how AI can reduce labor prices, which will cause the price of many items to fall. However, as he acknowledges, the prices of higher education, housing, and health care continue to rise. The raise in these prices would not be addressed by lowered labor cost.

Altman makes a good point in saying that, if labor (i.e. your job) ceases to exist, it wouldn't make sense to tax income; instead, it would make sense to tax the capital and redistribute it to the population. Altman is careful with his terminology, but he's advocating for UBI. 

> We could do something called the American Equity Fund. The American Equity Fund would be capitalized by taxing companies above a certain valuation 2.5% of their market value each year, payable in shares transferred to the fund, and by taxing 2.5% of the value of all privately-held land, payable in dollars.

> All citizens over 18 would get an annual distribution, in dollars and company shares, into their accounts. People would be entrusted to use the money however they needed or wanted—for better education, healthcare, housing, starting a company, whatever. Rising costs in government-funded industries would face real pressure as more people chose their own services in a competitive marketplace.


This is a very interesting proposal. I think this would be wildly unpopular by the wealthy, but it indeed would provide what he suggests. This is crazy to hear coming from a billionaire—but I suppose he wrote this before striking oil. 

If all people had the same amount of money, I wonder if capitalism would work better or worse. I remember in microeconomics we discussed the theory that, in a free market with scarcity, the good would always go to the person(s) who wanted it most *provided* that "want" was exactly proportional to money spent. 

He makes a phenomenal point that *taxing at a percent market cap* would be the most fair. You can't evade taxes because you want your investment to grow, so tough luck, Amazon.

In this case, I suppose you are taxing *unrealized gains* as well, in addition to what capital gains would cover. I remember Kamala had made a promise on her campaign that struck a nerve in tech bro twitter.

All of this sounds great; why can't we implement it today?

All this begs the question, if everything is in capital and nothing is in labor, the path between classes is effectively cut off. You won't be able to work your way up to a higher class because there will be no work to do. Those who are frozen in the higher class will, likely, stay there permanently—passing their assets to their children and so forth.
