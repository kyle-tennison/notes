# 12. Income Taxes

To compute **taxable income**:
1. First, **compute the depreciation** for each year. 
2. Subtract the depreciation and other expenditures from the gross income to get the taxable income.

> The method of depreciation will impact the taxable income. 

> Tax credits shouldn't change the taxable income, although they may have effects elsewhere.

Before tax cash flow (BTCF) is the standard flow of money (not including deprecation). You can find the after tax cash flow (ATCF) by computing the tax for the BTCF (for each cash flow row), then subtract the tax from the BTCF for the ATCF. 

You can calculate the IRR for the BTCF and the ATCF; it's possible to have $i^*>0$ for the BTCF and $i^*<0$ for the ATCF.
