# 2.1 Intro to Electronics

## 2.1.1 AC Circuits

$$V_t(t)=V_m cos(\omega t + \phi)$$

In this sinusoidal function:
- $\omega$ is the frequency
- $\phi$ is the phase angle
- $V_m$ is the amplitude

Remember $sin(\omega t) = cos(\omega t -90°)$ 

You can use the following equation to solve for the phase angle:****
$$\frac{∆T}{T}=\frac{|\phi|}{360°}$$

The relationship between period and frequency is:

$$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} \text{\;\;\;or\;\;\;}T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$



## 2.1.2 Phasors

A phasor can be described in polar or rectangular notation:


For 

$$v(t)=V cos(\omega t + \theta)$$
the corresponding phasor would be

$$\textbf V = V \angle \theta \text{\;\;\;or \;\;\;}\textbf V = a+bj$$

> $j$ is used as the complex number to avoid confusion with $i$ for current.

The *complex numbers* are considered the *rectangular* versions, and the *phase angle* is considered the *polar form*.

If the shifted sine wave is to the right, then the angle $\theta$ is negative. 

**Adding and subtracting** phasors is easiest in the rectangular form; just add and subtract the complex numbers as usual.

**Multiplying and dividing** phasors is easiest in polar form:

$$\textbf{A}\times \textbf{B}=A \angle \theta _1 \times B \angle \theta _2 = A\ B \angle \theta_1 + \theta_2 \tag{Multiplying}$$
$$\textbf{A}\div\textbf{B}=A\angle \theta_1 \div B \angle \theta_2 = A/B \angle \theta_1-\theta_2 \tag{Dividing}$$


## 2.1.3 Impedance

Impedance is the ratio of phasors of voltage and current:

$$Z = \frac{\textbf{V}}{\textbf{I}} = \frac{V\angle \theta_V}{I \angle \theta_i}$$

You can treat the impedance as a *complex resistance*—that being a resistance that is a complex number. If you *assume a steady-state sinusoidal voltage* the impedance of:
- A capacitor: $Z_C=-\frac{1}{j \omega C}$
- An inductor: $Z_L={j \omega L}$
- A resistor: $Z_R =  R$

## 2.1.4 AC Circuit Solution Method

1. Find the inductance of each component
2. Treat each component as a complex resistor
3. All the same resistor laws apply

## 2.1.6 Transfer Functions

You can come up with a *generic solution* to a circuit that does not depend on the amplitude, phase, or frequency. This is a *transfer function* which defines the input-output relationship of a circuit.

The transfer function is a *ratio* of the output and input:

$$H(\omega) =\frac{A_{out}\angle\theta_{out}}{A_{in}\angle\theta_{in}}$$


If we are only concerned with the magnitude or the angle of $H$, we can simplify this to:

$$|H(\omega )| = \frac{A_{out}}{A_{in}} \text{\;\;\;and\;\;\;} \angle H(\omega)= \theta_{out} - \theta_{in}$$

However, because transfer functions are generally used to find the output for some input, these are often more useful when expressed as:

$$A_{out} = |H(\omega)|A_{in} \text{\;\;\;and\;\;\;} \theta_{out} = \angle H(\omega)+\theta _{in}$$

If you have a DC component, you should transform it by $H(0)$.
