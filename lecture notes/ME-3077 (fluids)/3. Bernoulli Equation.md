# 3. Bernoulli Equation

## Newton's Second Law (3.1)

^a03c4e

The acceleration of a particle in a streamline is derived [here](4.%20Fluid%20Kinematics.md#^streamline-accel); in summary, it is:

$$\mathbf a = \underbrace{V\frac{\partial V}{\partial s}{\bf \hat s}}_{\large a_s} + \underbrace{\frac{V^2}{\mathscr R}{\bf \hat n}}_{\large a_n}$$

Where $\mathscr R$ is the instantaneous radius of curvature and $s$ is the distance along the streamline from an (arbitrary) reference point. More info about streamlines here: [Streamline Coordinates](4.%20Fluid%20Kinematics.md#Streamline%20Coordinates).

## Newton's Second Law *Tangent to Streamline* (3.2)

Consider an infinitesimal fluid particle of size $\delta s$ by $\delta n$. The application of [Newton's Second Law](Galileo's%20Relativity%20Principle.md#^newtons-second-law) in the $\hat {\bf s}$ axis is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum \partial F_s &= \delta m\,a_s 
\\&=\underbrace{\rho\,\delta V\!\!\!\!\!{-}}_{\text{mass}} \; \cdot \; \, \underbrace{\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial s} \right)}_{\text{accel}}
\end{aligned}$$

The figure above shows that $\theta$ gives the angle of the streamline relative to the $\hat x$ axis; thus, the *weight* acting *tangent* to the streamline is:

$$\delta \mathcal W_s = - \delta \mathcal W \sin(\theta) = - \gamma \,\delta V\!\!\!\!\!{-} \sin(\theta)$$

Likewise, the portion of weight acting *normal* to the streamline is:

$$\delta \mathcal W_n = - \gamma \, \delta V \!\!\!\!\!{-} \cos(\theta)$$

The force from pressure is not equal on both sides. A (one-term) Taylor series expansion lets us say:

$$\delta p_s \approx \frac{\partial p}{\partial s} \cdot \left (\frac{\delta s}{2} \right)$$

This allows us to say that the pressure force in the $\bf \hat s$ direction is:

$$\delta F_{ps} = \underbrace{(p - \delta p_s)}_{\text{left-side pressure}}\delta n \delta y - \underbrace{(p + \delta p_s)}_{\text{right-side pressure}} \delta n \delta y = 2 \, \delta p_s \,\delta n \, \delta y$$

Then, substituting $\delta p_s = \frac{\partial p}{\partial s} \frac{\delta s}{2}$ gives:

$$\delta F_{ps} = 2\left( - \frac{\partial p}{\partial s} \frac{\delta s }2 \right) \delta n\, \delta y = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial s} \delta V \!\!\!\!\!{-}$$

---

Now, if we sum the pressure quantities together and **neglect viscous effects** (thus making this only valid for inviscid fluids) we can say:

$$\sum \delta F_s = \delta \mathcal W_s+ \delta F_{ps} = \left(-\gamma \sin (\theta)-\frac{\partial p}{\partial s}\right) \delta V \!\!\!\!\!{-}$$

Combining this with $\sum \delta F_s = \delta m \, a_s$ gives:

$$ \underbracket{
- \gamma \sin\theta - \frac{\partial p}{\partial s} = pV \frac{\partial V}{\partial s} = \rho a_s
}_{\text{intuitive}}$$
^intiutive-form

In this form it is easiest to see what the relationship is. The acceleration (times density) is simply the parts of the pressure gradient and the specific weight that act along $\bf \hat s$. 

This can be reduced further: Note that $\sin \theta = dz / ds$ and $V \; dV/Ds = \frac 12 d(V^2)/ds$. Then, because along a streamline (which is definitionally tangent to velocity), $n \equiv 0$. Therefore:

$$\begin{aligned}
dp &= \frac{\partial p}{\partial s}\cdot ds + \frac{\partial p}{\partial n}\cdot \cancelto 0{dn}\\\\
&=\frac{\partial p}{\partial s}\cdot ds 
\end{aligned}$$

Thus,

$$\frac{\partial p}{\partial s} =\frac{dp}{ds} \qquad (\text{along a streamline})$$


Substituting these into the [equation above](#^intiutive-form) gives:

$$-\gamma \frac{dz}{ds}- \frac{dp}{ds} = \frac 12 \rho \frac{d \left (V^2 \right)}{ds}$$

"multiplying" by $ds$ on all sides gives

$$\gamma\, dz + dp + \frac 12 \rho \, d\big(V^2\big) = 0$$

then dividing all terms by $\rho$ and rearranging gives:

$$\frac{dp}{\rho}+\frac 12 d\big( V^2 \big) + g\,dz = 0$$

Which, once integrated is:

$$\begin{aligned}
&\int \frac{dp}{\rho} + \int\frac 12 d\big(V^2\big) + \int g \,dz\\& = \underbrace{\left [ \int \frac{dp}{\rho}\right] + \frac 12 V^2 + gz = C}_{\text{along a streamline}}
\end{aligned}
$$


The $\int dp / \rho$ term is often difficult to solve for. If **density is assumed to be constant** (incompressible flow), the equation becomes:

$$\underbracket{\boxed{p + \frac 12 \rho V^2+ \gamma z = \text{constant along a streamline}}}_{\Huge \text{\bf Bernoulli Equation}}$$
^bernoulli-equation

Summarized, the **assumptions** are:
1. Viscous effects are negligible 
2. The flow is steady
3. The fluid is incompressible
4. The equation is applicable along a streamline

Notice how this equation is nearly identical to the thermodynamics energy balance.

## Newton's Second Law *Normal to Streamline* (3.3)

We can derive some laws if we follow a similar procedure as the prior section, except looking at the kinetics normal to the streamline.

$$\sum \delta F_n = \delta m \, a_n = (\rho \, \delta V \!\!\!\!\!{-}) \left( \frac{V^2}{\mathscr R}\right)$$

If we again assume that the flow is *inviscid*, then the only forces are pressure and weight, those being:

$$\delta \mathcal W_n = \gamma \, \delta V \!\!\!\!\!{-} \cos(\theta)$$

$$\delta F_{pn} = (p - \delta p_n) \delta s\delta y - (p+ \delta p_n) \delta s \delta y = -2 \delta p_n \, \delta s \,\delta y$$

where $\delta p_n$ is also a one-term Taylor series expansion: $\delta p_n = (\partial p / \partial n) (\delta p / 2)$. Once again, this $\delta F_{pn}$ term reduces once you substitute this $\delta p_n$ term in:

$$\delta F_{pn} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial n} \delta V \!\!\!\!\!{-} $$
Plugging these two forces into the $\bf \hat n$ axis force balance gives:

$$\delta \mathcal W_n + \delta F_{pn} = \left( -\gamma \cos \theta - \frac{\partial p}{\partial n} \right) \delta V \!\!\!\!\!{-} = (\rho \, \delta V \!\!\!\!\!{-}) \left( \frac{V^2}{\mathscr R}\right)$$

Simplifying and substituting $\cos \theta = dz / dn$ gives:

$$-\gamma \frac{dz}{dn}- \frac{\partial p}{\partial n} = \frac{\rho V^2}{\mathscr R}$$

We can interpret this as: *a larger speed/density, or a smaller radius of curvature will demand more force to interrupt the motion of the fluid particles.*

Like we did in the Bernoulli equation, if we multiply by $dn$, then integrate, we get:

$$\left[\int \frac{dp} \rho \right] + \left[\int \frac{V^2}{\mathscr R}dn \right] + gz = \text{const over streamline}$$

Again, assuming density is constant (incompressible fluid), we can say:

$$\boxed{p + \rho \int \frac{V^2}{\mathscr R} dn \;+ gz = \text{const over streamline} }$$


## Static, Stagnation, Dynamic, and Total Pressure

All of the terms in the [Bernoulli Equation](#^bernoulli-equation) have units of force per unit area. We can think of each term as a different kind of pressure.

$${p + \frac 12 \rho V^2+ \gamma z = \text{const.}}$$

1. The $p$ term is **static pressure**
2. The $\gamma z$ term is **hydrostatic pressure**, previously mentioned [here](2.%20Equation%20of%20Hydrostatics.md#^hydrostatic-pressure)
3. The $\frac 12 \rho V^2$ term is the **dynamic pressure** 
4. The sum of all of these, i.e. $\text{const.}$ in the equation above, is the **total pressure**

For flow around a blunt body, there is a **stagnation point** where $V=0$.

If you identify a point $2$ where $V_2=0$, you can compare it to another point $1$ where $V_1 \ne 0$. 

$$p_2 = p_1 + \frac 12 \rho V_1^2$$

Here, we can see that the (static) pressure at point 2 (the stagnation point) is necessarily higher than the other point where fluid is flowing.

The **stagnation streamline** divides the fluid into parts that flow over versus under the stagnation point.
