# Exam Notes

Some general notes from studying for the final

---

- Hard magnetic materials retain their magnetization after the magnetic field is gone‚Äîsoft magnetic materials don't.
- Randomly polarized light will obtain a preferential polarization after reflection, even if the surface is smooth.
- Randomly polarized light will decrease in intensity by 50% when encountering a polarizer.
- A sacrificial anode should have a higher Standard Reduction Potential than the substance it is protecting.  
> ü§ñ (notecheck comment) - This statement is reversed. A sacrificial anode must have a more negative (i.e., lower) Standard Reduction Potential so that it is preferentially oxidized, protecting the metal it is coupled with.
- You cannot have 5-fold symmetry in a crystal.
- A hexagonal crystal will have 6-fold rotational symmetry.

## Questions

- What is galvanic corrosion?
	- [Galvanic Corrosion](Galvanic%20Corrosion.md)
- What is the difference between anodic and cathodic corrosion?
	- Cathodic protection is protection from a sacrificial anode.
	- Anodic protection is stainless steel stuff, which isn't covered in this class.
- Which of the BCC, FCC, HCP isn't close packed?
	- BCC is not close packed.
- Ceramics tend to be resistant to corrosion.
- Will all cubic unit cells have a coordination of 6?
	- No, it depends on if it's primitive (6), BCC (8), or FCC (12).
- How do you find the coordination number?
	- The coordination number is the number of nearest atoms. But you can just memorize the numbers for the few crystals on the exam.
- What in the world is going on here:
	![](../../media/Pasted%20image%2020241202200934.webp)
	- This is a BCC unit cell, so we know that there are 2 lattice points. If we count the number of atoms, we see there are two oxygens and four coppers. Now, if we divide this count by the number of lattice points, we get the basis, which is 1 oxygen and 2 copper.
- Is this question missing an equals sign?
	![](../../media/Pasted%20image%2020241202201403.webp)
	- I don't know.
- How do we get to this conclusion?
	  ![](../../media/Pasted%20image%2020241202202302.webp)
	- The depth of the curve is related to the melting point.
- What is fatigue failure?
	- Propagation of micro-cracks until failure.
- What is shot peening?
	- Like super-sandblasting a material to put small divots in its surface. These divots are under compression and help the material resist micro-cracks, and hence, fatigue failure. [Fracture and Failure](Fracture%20and%20Failure.md)
- What is fictive temperature?
	- Fictive temperature is the apparent temperature that describes how a glass is frozen in place. [Amorphous Solids](Amorphous%20Solids.md)
- What is creep?
	- [Structure of Polymers](Structure%20of%20Polymers.md) has to deal with constant stress applied over time.
	- There is also stress relaxation too.
- What is cyclic loading?
	- A series of loading and relaxing cycles.
- What is dislocation motion vs climb?
	- *Not sure where climb comes from.*
	- Dislocation motion is the sliding along a line of bonds. [Dislocations](Dislocations.md)
- What is "diffusion through the bulk" and "diffusion through the grain boundaries"?
	- *Also not sure where this comes from.*
- What is "Charpy Impact Testing"?
	- You measure how much energy a pendulum absorbs when breaking a material by looking at its gravitational potential energy change during the swing. [Fracture and Failure](Fracture%20and%20Failure.md)
- What is "Dilatometry"?
	- The study of how materials change with time and temperature. Most relevant is its study of the CTE and phase changes.
- What is the Weibull distribution and how does this relate to a "shape parameter" and "characteristic lifetime"?
	- A probability function of a material to fail after some period of time. [Fracture and Failure](Fracture%20and%20Failure.md)
	- Shape parameter is the $\beta$ in the equation.
	- Characteristic lifetime is $N_0$, which is when about 63% (double check that number) of samples fail.
- What is phase assemblage?
	- A term describing a combination (assembly) of phases in a material.
- What is solid state diffusion?
	- If a material is hot enough, particles can diffuse through a solid lattice, just like (kind of) through a liquid. The activation energy is much higher, however.
- What does flame polishing do?
	- Makes a rough surface seem clear. [Structure of Polymers](Structure%20of%20Polymers.md)
- How can we tell which materials are susceptible to creep?
	- Do we have to?
- Why does the Ti-5Al alloy fail but 4340 steel doesn't at $10^5$ cycles at 500 MPa?
	![|310](../../media/Pasted%20image%2020241203183523.webp)
	- I think I might have misread this?
- Is it always fair to extrapolate in situations like this? Apparently you can tell that Ductile cast iron won't fail under 200 MPa at $10^9$ cycles
	![|363](../../media/Pasted%20image%2020241203183704.webp)
	- If there is a horizontal line, then you can extrapolate the behavior for $\infty$ cycles.
- What is Binary Isomorphous Diagrams?
	- If something follows the Hume-Rothery rules, it will have a binary isomorphous phase diagram.
- What is the lever rule? 
- Ecliptic points/diagrams????
	- It looks like the Pikachu one.
- You cannot predict the melting point only given two materials, unless you have the phase diagram.
- Entropy drives vacancies.
- No questions on acoustic impedance.
- How do BCC/other crystals change with cooling and brittle modes?
- Look up some of the polymer crystallinity stuff.
- Viscoelastic materials
	- [Structure of Polymers](Structure%20of%20Polymers.md) under Time Dependency.
	- Deborah number?
- Cooling rate of glasses
	- ![|391](../../media/IMG_9073.webp)
- What are the results of adding modifiers?
	- It lowers the glass transition temperature.
- X-Ray Scattering can be used to determine short-range order to obtain a radial distribution function.
- We need to know the dimensionality of our defects.
	- Dopants are point defects.
- Need to tell if something is an n-type or p-type.
	- If you need to find a dopant for a compound, you need to be told which individual atom to look at.
	- If an atom is to the right of the semiconductor atom on the periodic table, it will be an N-type. If it's to the left, it will be a P-type.
- Need to know defect notation.
	- $V_{A}^{+1}$
- Memorize the Hume-Rothery rules.
	- I don't want to.
- Heavier elements will increase the intensity of X-ray diffraction.

- Crystals need translational symmetry.
- 360/#num folds is the degree of rotation that must yield the same shape.
- 5,7,8,9, and higher-fold rotational symmetries.
- What the fuck is coordination number?
	- The number of nearest neighbor atoms.
- Remember ABCABC and ABAB
	- in my notes.
- Which of FCC, HCP, etc. are close packed?
	- FCC and HCP; BCC is not.
- FCC always has four lattice points; you multiply this by the basis to get the number of atoms in the unit cell.
	- Remember the number of lattice points for each type of cell.
	- You can use this to solve for the basis.
	- $\text{\#lattice points} \times \text{\#atoms basis} = \text{\#atoms in unit cell}$ 
- Don't worry about polymer synthesis routes; these will not be on the test.
- What the hell is Fick's first law (ch 1.5)?
- Galvanization involves using a different metal. Usually, iron is coated in zinc.
	- *Cathodic* protection uses a sacrificial *anode*. 
	- [Galvanic Corrosion](Galvanic%20Corrosion.md)
- A high stiffness (elastic modulus) will have the tightest curve in the bond-energy graph.

3. C ‚ùå (A)
	1. I think dislocations increase the elastic modulus.
	2. It increases the yield strength, not the elastic modulus. Think about [Work Hardening](Dislocations.md#Work%20Hardening) and how it shifts the stress‚Äìstrain curve. Imagine stacking this new curve over the original curve.
4. E ‚úÖ
5. A ‚úÖ
	1. I would expect this to be true because going from gas to liquid releases heat (exothermic).

31. E ‚ùå (C)

33. D ‚úÖ
34. B ‚úÖ
35. D ‚úÖ
	1. Joules/Area = $\frac{N\cdot m}{m^2} = \frac{N}{m}$, I honestly don't know.

	1. No clue.
55. C ‚úÖ

59. A ‚úÖ
60. C ‚úÖ
61. D ‚ùå (E)
	1. I'm guessing that BCC is going to be more ductile because there are more slip systems.
	2. Ductility: HCP < BCC < FCC, apparently.
62. A ‚úÖ
	1. I don't even know what this is asking.
	2. The lattice points on a BCC, FCC, or HCP are fixed? I suppose that makes sense.
63. D ‚ùå (B)

	2. They say fracture toughness is a material constant, but the calculation...

	2. It's not FCC, it's BCC. Woopsie.
65. B ‚úÖ
