# 1. Axial Bar

### Internal Axial Force

For a force with a single normal load, the internal axial force is agnostic to the cross section location.

If you don't have such a clean cross section, you can always find $N$ (normal force) with:

$$N = \iint_A \sigma_{xx} dA$$

If stress is uniform:

$$N = \sigma_{xx}A \qquad \text{and, consequently}\qquad \sigma_{xx}= \frac NA$$

More systematically, if you can quantify the tress across a bar as:

Then, for any cross section like this:

%%[ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw](excalidraw-2025-09-01-16.44.04.excalidraw.md)%%

You can say:

$$N(x_c) = \int \limits _{x_c}^L p_x(x)dx$$

In reality, this is an oversimplification:
