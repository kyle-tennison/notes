# De Broglie Wavelength

Louis de Broglie proposed in 1924 that matter itself is a wave; we call these **matter waves**, which are a fundamental piece of quantum theory and demonstrate the **particle-wave duality**. They show how matter exhibits wave-like behavior.

The wavelength is tied to the momentum of the particle:

$$ \lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$

where $h$ is [Planck's Constant](../reference.md#Planck's%20Constant) and $p$ is the particle's momentum. 

### Background

The **Planck-Einstein** relationship, which was developed after Einstein described the photoelectric effect, explains that the energy in a photon is:

$$E = h \nu $$

where $h$ is again Planck's Constant and $\nu$ is the frequency. [Einstein's second postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulates_of_special_relativity) of special relativity establishes the relativistic relationships between energy and momentum.
