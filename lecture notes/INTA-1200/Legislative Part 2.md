Lawmaking
- Proposals
	- House or senate member submits a bill
		- **Only** members of congress can submit a bill, nobody else, including the president.
		- They can be written by anyone, but they need to get submitted by a member of congress.
	- ~9000 proposed bills per year
	- A committee is assigned the bill, the selection depends on the topic
	- Most proposed bills are ignored so that they can stay focused
	- Many lawmakers will propose bills knowing they will get ignored for bragging reasons.
- Referrals
	- Where a bill gets referred
	- The Speaker can strategically ignore a bill by referring it to a committee that is likely to ignore it 
	- Split referral: Allows the speaker to split a bill into sections and to assign each section to a different committee
- Committee Action
	- Committee and subcommittee chairs ignore almost all bills
	- The subcommittee can mark up a bill, then pass it to the main committee, which then can make further amendments
	- **mark-up** is the process where committees and subcommittees edit and amend bills
- Moving bills to the floor
	- If the committee gives the green flag, they report it to the floor with a written report arguing in its favor
	- The rules committee can assert:
		- Open rule: Where any amendment can be proposed
			- Allows an unrestricted process to gut or kill a bill
		- Closed rule: Where no amendments can be proposed
			- This is to prevent the floor from amending the bill to death until it is useless
		- Restricted (or modified) rule - only certain kinds of amendments can be proposed
- Senate Distinctiveness
	- Senate is different from the house in the way that bills get moved to the floor
	- Unanimous consent agreements: All members must agree for a bill to progressâ€”a single person can stop it
	- **Filibuster**: A member of the senate speaks for a expended period of time in attempt to block the rest of the senate from voting on a bill. You can also invoke a filibuster without actually talking for that long
	- **Cloture**: Limits debate on a bill to so many hours. 60 votes is required to end the filibuster
- Floor Action
	- **Veto** - The president can reject a bill
	- A lot of time people take this time to advertise themselves in front of the camera
	- Votes are public
	- If a bill can't be reconciled between house and senate through the conference committee, it will die, but this is pretty uncommon.
	- If the president doesn't sign a bill within 10 days that it is passed to him, it will be a **pocket veto**
