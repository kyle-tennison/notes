# 1. Cartesian Particle Motion

Alongside a *free body diagram*, we can draw a *kinematic diagram* that shows the $ma$ side of the $F=ma$ law.

Then, in each axis, you can do:

$$\begin{cases}
\sum F_x =0 \\
\sum F_y =0 \\
\sum F_z =0 \\
\end{cases}$$

Or, in this case:
$$\begin{cases}
0 &= m \ddot x\\
-mg &= m \ddot y\\
0 &= m \ddot z
\end{cases}$$

Little trick, if you wanna integrate an acceleration to get velocity (or smth like that), but don't want to solve for the $C$ that arises from the indefinite integral, you can instead do:

$$a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} \Rightarrow  \int dv = \int dt$$

Kinematics talk about the geometry of motion.
Kinetics talks about the forces that govern motion.

I think it might be backwards.

$$
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
\hat i_a\\ \hat j_a
\end{bmatrix}}_{A}
=
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
cos(\theta) & - sin(\theta)\\ 
sin(\theta) & cos(\theta)
\end{bmatrix}}_{R}
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
\hat i_b \\
\hat j_b
\end{bmatrix}}_{B}
$$

It happens that $R^{-1}=R^T$ because it's "orthogonal". This lets you now do both:

$$A = \mathbf R B \qquad \text{and}\qquad B = \mathbf R^{-1}A$$

Or you could flip the sign theta like a normal person.
