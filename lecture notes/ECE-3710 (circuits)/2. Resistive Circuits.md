## 2.1 Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)

Kirchhoff's voltage law states that **the sum of voltages around any loop is zero.**

If voltage is gravitational potential energy, walking around any terrain in a loop would mean that the sum of changes in height would also be zero.

Remember, the voltage over a current source is nonzero. Even if it is not given, it must be accounted for.

## 2.2 Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)

Kirchhoff's current law states that **the sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving that node.**

$$\sum _i I = \sum _e I$$

You could expand this in a few ways:
1. If you flip the signs of current such that all "arrows" lead *into* the node, you can say that *the sum of all currents entering the node is zero*.
2. If you flip the signs of current such that all "arrows" lead *out of* the node, you can say that *the sum of all currents exiting the node is zero.*

> I like the first version. Think of all arrows that point into the node.

## 2.3 Series & Parallel Resistors

**Resistors in Series** simply sum:

$$R_{eq} = \sum_i R_i \tag{Series}$$

**Resistors in Parallel** do this inverse thing:

$$R_{eq} = \bigg[\sum _i \frac{1}{R_i}   \bigg]^{-1} \tag{Parallel}$$

## 2.4 Equivalent Resistance

**Equivalent Resistance** is the total resistance of a combination of resistors that, if replaced by a single resistor of equivalent resistance, would yield the same circuit.

## 2.5 Voltage Divider Law

The voltage divider law is:

$$V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}V_{in}$$

This is derived from KVL and ohm's law. First you find the current from the ESR, then use ohm's law to find the voltage drop over the first one. 

> Try reducing the number of resistors before applying this voltage law.

## 2.6 Current Divider Law

![|268](../../media/Pasted%20image%2020250110133358.webp)

$$I_{out} = \frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}I_{in}$$

You can derive this by replacing the resistors by a single equivalent resistor. From this, you can find the voltage drop across the equivalent resistor. Because there resistors are in parallel, the voltage drop will be equal. Finally, plug this voltage drop into Ohm's law and you get the equation above.

## 2.9 Mesh Analysis

A systematic way to solve resistive circuits.

1. Identify each non-inclusive loop
2. Set an arbitrary current for each loop and solve KVL.
3. Solve for the arbitrary currents

In a situation like this, the voltage across $R_2$ depends on both $I_1$ and $I_2$. The way we would express this is $R_2(I_1 - I_3)$. We would need to do something similar for $R_2$. When you do this, you end up with a system of equations to solve.

## 2.10 Node Analysis

Another systematic application of KCL

1. Select a ground node
2. Define arbitrary node voltages
3. Do a KCL at nodes with unknown voltages
4. Solve for node voltages
