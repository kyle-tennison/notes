# 7. Fluid Kinematics


Chapter 4

---

Fluid kinematics describes the motion of a fluid without describing the forces that govern that motion. Most importantly to this motion is the *velocity field.* The velocity field is usually represented as:

$${\bf V} = \langle u, v, w\rangle $$

Often time, if the "velocity" of a fluid is mentioned, the magnitude of velocity is really sought after.

## Eulerian vs Lagrangian Flow

**Eulerian Flow** is most common and treats everything as a field. This field may change over time. Think of a temperature field or velocity field; plain and simple.

**Lagrangian Flow** follows a fluid parcel in space. For each fluid parcel, everything is only a function of time.

If enough information is available that allows one to discover the coordinates of a fluid parcel, it is possible to move between Eulerian and Lagrangian flows.

## Streamlines, Streaklines, and Pathlines

A **Streamline** is a mathematical concept that allows us to draw a curve that is tangent to velocity at every point. In $\mathbb R^2$, this is:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac vu$$

In turbulent flow, streamlines will usually change with time. However, in steady state flow, streamlines remain constant. More on steady state flow below.

**Streaklines** are defined by: "the path traced by all fluid particles that have passed through a particular fixed point in space over time." 

A **Pathline** is the path traced by *one* fluid element. A collection of pathlines that share a common point gives streaklines.

When flow is steady, streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines all share the same path. The same is not true for unsteady flow.

## Material Derivatives

[Material Derivatives](Material%20Derivatives.md) has many different names (see linked page). The operator is defined as:

$$\frac{D(\quad)}{Dt} \equiv \underbrace{\frac{\partial (\quad)}{\partial t}}_{\text{local derivative}}+ \underbrace{u \frac{\partial (\quad)}{\partial x}+ v \frac{\partial (\quad)}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial (\quad)}{\partial z}}_{\text{convective derivative}}$$

This accounts for local changes that may occur when following a single particle in a Lagrangian flow, along with the changes that come with the particle's position. 

This equation is alternatively expressed as:

$$\frac{D(\quad)}{Dt}  \equiv \frac{\partial (\quad)}{\partial t} + (\mathbf V \cdot \nabla) (\quad)$$

This notation is confusing at first, but the main reason it is done is to show that it's an operator. This can equivalently be expressed as:

$$\frac{D(\quad)}{Dt}  \equiv \frac{\partial (\quad)}{\partial t} + \mathbf V \cdot \bigl(\nabla (\quad) \bigr)$$

This can be used to find the acceleration field:

$$\boxed{\mathbf a = \frac{D\mathbf V}{Dt} = \frac{\partial \mathbf V}{\partial t} + \mathbf V \cdot \nabla \mathbf V}$$
^accel-eq

> For a scalar field $\phi$, $\nabla \phi$ is just the gradient; for a vector field $\mathbf A$, $\nabla \mathbf A$ is the *[Jacobian Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant)*

## Steady Flow

~~If the *local derivative of velocity* $\partial \mathbf V / \partial t = 0$, the flow is said to be steady.

$$\frac{\partial \mathbf V}{\partial t} \equiv 0 \qquad \text{(steady flow)}$$


If the *local time derivative of all properties* is zero, then a flow is said to be steady:

$$\frac{\partial (\quad)}{\partial t} \equiv 0 \quad \forall \text{ properties}  \qquad \text{(Steady Flow)}$$


### Example: Uniform Pipe Velocity

![[image-2.png]]

In a pipe with uniform velocity; it can be seen that velocity does not change with position. This means that the convective derivative is zero.

However, if the velocity is gradually changing (though uniform with space),

$$\frac{\partial \mathbf V}{\partial t} \ne 0$$

and the flow is therefore *not steady.*

To contrast, if velocity were not changing with time, then $\partial _t \mathbf V = 0$ and the flow would be *steady*.

### Example: Variable Area Pipe

![[image-3.png]]


Although the velocity changes with position, it does not change with time. This is an instance of where the convection derivative is nonzero, but the local derivative is zero. Because

$$\frac{\partial \mathbf V}{\partial t} = 0,$$

this is indeed a *steady* flow.


## Streamline Coordinates

At any point along a streamline, we may define two directions, $\bf \hat s$ and $\bf \hat n$, which are respectively tangent and normal to the streamline (assuming 2D). The scalar $s$ is the distance along the streamline; similar to how $x$ is the distance along the $\bf \hat x$ axis. 

Because $\bf \hat s$ is always perpendicular to $\bf V$, we can say:

$$\mathbf V = V \mathbf {\hat s}$$

Then, because the [acceleration eq.](#^accel-eq) is defined as $D\mathbf V/ Dt$, we can say:

$$\mathbf a = \frac{D\mathbf V}{Dt} = \frac{D(V \mathbf{\hat s})}{Dt} = \frac{DV}{Dt}\mathbf {\hat s} + V \frac{D \mathbf{\hat s}}{Dt}$$
by the chain rule. Expanded, this is:

$$\mathbf a = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial V}{\partial s}\frac{d s}{d t}+\frac{\partial V}{\partial n}\frac{d n}{d t}\right) \mathbf{\hat s} + V\left(\frac{\partial {\bf \hat s}}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial {\bf \hat s}}{\partial s}\frac{d {s}}{d t}+\frac{\partial {\bf \hat s}}{\partial n}\frac{dn}{d t}\right)$$

For **steady flow**, we know that $\partial V / \partial t \equiv 0$ by definition and $\partial {\bf \hat s} / \partial t$ because the streamlines do not change shape in steady flow. 

We also know that, because $\mathbf V = \dot {\bf q}$ (q being pos), *and* that $\hat {\bf s}$ is always normal to the velocity field that:

$$\frac{ds}{dt}= V\qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{dn}{dt}=0$$

Substituting these steady-flow simplifications into the equation reduces it to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf a &= \left(\cancelto 0{\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}}+\frac{\partial V}{\partial s}\underbrace{\frac{ds}{dt}}_{V}+\frac{\partial V}{\partial n}\cancelto{0}{\frac{d n}{d t}}\right) \mathbf{\hat s} + V\left(\cancelto{0}{\frac{\partial {\bf \hat s}}{\partial t}}+\frac{\partial {\bf \hat s}}{\partial s}\underbrace{\frac{d {s}}{d t}}_{V}+\frac{\partial {\bf \hat s}}{\partial n}\cancelto{0}{\frac{dn}{d t}}\right)\\\\
&=\left(V \frac{\partial V}{\partial s}\right){\bf \hat s} + V\left(V \frac{\partial {\bf \hat s}}{\partial s}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$


The term $\partial {\bf \hat s} / \partial s$ can be reduced further. Consider this figure:

![[image-4.png]]

As $\delta s \to 0$, the two sides of the bottom-right triangle adjacent to $\delta \theta$ become equal;

$${\bf \hat s}(s) = {\bf \hat s} (s + \delta s) \quad\text{ as }\quad  \delta s\to 0$$

Similarly, the two sides of the upper-right triangle will also be equal. Therefore **these are similar triangles**. 

This allows us to derive the relationship that:

$$\frac{\delta s }{\mathscr R} = \frac{| \delta{\bf \hat s|}}{\cancelto{1}{|\bf \hat s|}}$$

Note that ${\bf | \hat s |} = 1$ always (it is a unit vector). Rearranging this to solve for the aforementioned $\partial {\bf \hat s} / \partial s$ term gives:

$$\frac{\partial {\bf \hat s}} {\partial s} = \frac{\bf \hat n}{\mathscr R}$$

Where $\bf \hat n$ is the other component of this coordinate system that was introduced at the start.

Substituting this into the original acceleration equation gives:

$$\mathbf a = \underbrace{V\frac{\partial V}{\partial s}{\bf \hat s}}_{\large a_s} + \underbrace{\frac{V^2}{\mathscr R}{\bf \hat n}}_{\large a_n}$$

## Reynold's Transport Theorem

Let $B$ be an *extensive property* and $b$ be an *intensive property* such that

$$B = mb$$

In the case that $B$ is mass, $b$ is analogous to "specific mass" which is just $b=1$. 

A **system** is defined as a collection of fluid parcels. This is in practice hard to track, but it is important to make the distinction from a control volume.

A **control volume** is what it's always been.

The extensive property can be found for a *system* by integrating over everything:
$$\delta B_{sys} = b \,\delta m = b \rho \,\delta V$$

$$B_{sys} = \int_{sys}\rho b \;dV$$

For obvious reasons, the time derivative is:

$$\dot B_{sys} = \frac{d \left(\int_{sys}\rho b \;dV \right)}{dt}$$

For a control volume, a nearly identical process may be applied:

$$\dot B_{cv} = \frac{d \left(\int_{cv}\rho b \;dV \right)}{dt}$$

However, it is imperative to note that:

$$\dot B_{sys} \ne \dot B_{cv}$$

even when the system and the control volume occupy the same area. For example, a fire extinguisher expelling it's contents will have a $\dot m_{sys} =0$ because no mass is destroyed; however, the $\dot m _{cv} \ne 0$ because mass is leaving the control volume.

---

**Reynold's transport theorem** provides a way to move between $B_{sys}$ and $B_{cv}$.  A derivation is provided in 4.4.1 (p. 184) which I will not copy here.

A this theorem states:

$$\frac{DB_{sys}}{Dt} = \frac{\partial B_{cv}}{\partial t}+\dot B_{out} - \dot B_{in}$$

We can give simple expressions to $\dot B_{out}$ and $\dot B_{in}$ if the following assumptions are true...

1. Fixed control volume
2. One inlet and one outlet
	1. If there is no inlet or outlet, you can say simply say $\dot B_{\text{in/out}}=0$ 
3. Uniform properties ($\rho$, $V$, $b$) at the inlet/outlet control boundaries
4. Normal velocity to inlet/outlet boundaries

... then this may be expressed as:

$$\frac{DB_{sys}}{Dt} = \frac{\partial B_{cv}}{\partial t} + \rho_2 A_2 V_2 b_2 - \rho_1 A_1 V_1 b_1$$

where subscript $2$ represents outlet conditions and subscript $1$ represents inlet conditions. 

In cases where $\frac{DB_{sys}}{Dt}$ is known, such as $Dm_{sys}/Dt = 0$ (always), we can use this formula to *solve for inlet/outlet conditions*. 

Similarly, some cases will have a $\frac{d \left(\int_{cv}\rho b \;dV \right)}{dt}$ that is readily known. For example, if we are concerned with mass and $b=1$, *and* it is known that the flow is *steady*, we know that:

$$\frac{d \left(\int_{cv}\rho  \;dV \right)}{dt} = 0 \qquad (\text{steady flow})$$


A **more general form** can be found if we replace these algebraic terms with a flux equation:

$$\dot B_{\text{out}} - \dot B_{\text{in}} = \int_{\text{cs}} \rho b\mathbf V \cdot {\bf \hat n}\,dA$$

Seems pretty intuitive. A more thorough derivation on p. 189. 

The $\partial B_{cv}/\partial t$ term can also be written in integral form:

$$\frac{\partial B_{\text{cv}}}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{\text{cv}} \rho b \, dV \llap{-}$$

Everything together gives the formal definition:

$$\boxed{
\frac{DB_{\text{sys}}}{Dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{\text{cv}} \rho b \, dV\llap{-} + \int_{\text{cs}} \rho b \mathbf V \cdot {\bf \hat n}\, dA
}$$

Similar to how $\partial (\quad) / \partial t \equiv 0$ for steady flows, the term

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{\text{cv}} \rho b \, dV\llap{-} = 0 \qquad \tag{{steady flow}}$$

such that:

$$
\frac{DB_{\text{sys}}}{Dt} =\int_{\text{cs}} \rho b \mathbf V \cdot {\bf \hat n}\, dA \quad \tag{steady flow}
$$



Also, similar to the [Material Derivative](#Material%20Derivatives), Reynold's transport theorem may be applied to $Bs$ that are either scalars or vectors.

## Moving Control Volume

If $\mathbf V_A$ is the velocity of a fluid parcel, it will have a relative velocity $\mathbf W_A$ relative to a moving control volume with velocity $\mathbf V_{CV}$

Like any frame translation, we can relate these quantities using:

$$\mathbf V_A = \mathbf V_{CV} + \mathbf W_A$$
^rel-velocity

Then, the [Reynold's Transport Theorem](#Reynold's%20Transport%20Theorem) for a moving control volume is:

$$\frac{DB_{sys}}{Dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{cv}\rho b \, dV + \int_{cs} \rho b \, \mathbf W \cdot {\bf \hat n}\; dA$$
