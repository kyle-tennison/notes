Judicial Branch (I)
- Established by article III
- Allowed congress to create inferior courts, if needed.
- Article III sets up no power for other courts, left that up to congress.
- Alexander Hamilton thought the judicial branch would be "the least dangerous branch"
	- They thought congress would be the most powerful, because it had the most enumerated powers
	- Thought that judges should serve for life
	- Main intent was to make unconstitutional bills void
- Supreme court cannot enforce their decisions 
	- Depends on how much the other branches respect their rule

Judicial Branch (II)
- Judicial Review
	- Check if the stuff is consistent with the constitution
	- Was intended from the very start. Intentional.
- Supreme Court
	- Nine active members, but not fixed in the constitution
	- New cases look to previous rulings. They try to make their rulings predictable. 
	- Reluctant to enact natural rights that haven't been decided before.
	- They should not have any political reasoning for passing something. Their one, sole goal is to determine whether or not the constitution supports something.
	- President appoints justices, but the senate has to approve
- You could pack the court by ...
	- 1) Expanding the number of seats
	- 2) Making appointments if someone leaves
- You could impeach a member, or pull the budget to the supreme court.
	- Congress can also prevent the supreme court from hearing certain cases.
		- This has happened with topics of natural security
