# The Question Concerning Technology
 
Martin Heidegger
---

Starts with the idea from Aristotle that things should only be as complex as they need to be.
> ðŸ¤– (notecheck comment) - The statement above incorrectly attributes the principle of parsimony (commonly associated with Occamâ€™s Razor) to Aristotle. This notion is not directly found in Aristotleâ€™s works and can cause confusion about Heideggerâ€™s argument.

Comments on how ignorance can be worse than direct opposition to something.

Explores what "cause" really means. Thinks about how things are vectors with values that can reach into different dimensions. He finds that there are four causes:
1. Material
2. Formal
3. Efficient
4. Final

These come from Aristotle.

Argues that what technology is needs to be "revealed" to us.

> "Freedom is the realm of the destining that at any given time starts a revealing on its way."

He argues that mystery is key to freedom. 

The threat of technology is not necessarily what currently exists, but its seeding has been around for a long time. The author wrote this at the time of the atomic bomb and was well aware of the dangers; however, he points out that the real issue is that technology will continue to grow. This is especially applicable to contemporary times.

Final comment about memento mori.
