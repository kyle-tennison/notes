## Notes

#### Dynamics

David Torello (9:30 AM): Requires passing 9 of the pass/fail exams for an A; he has a higher average GPA

Levi Wood (3:30 PM): Receives good reviews but has a low average GPA

#### Fluids
  
Suresh, Suhasjain: 5 stars, good time, *low seats*

Other two are equally mid

#### Def Bods

Aditya Kumar: Good reviews, poor time

George Kardomateas: Seems like the easiest section; perfect time

#### Statistics

ECE 3077 Romberg, Justin: Seems like a hard professor but a good class.

#### Humanities 

HIST 2062: Lu, Hanchao; sounds like a decent class that fits the schedule  
HTS 3035: Spencer, Beth; also sounds decent
