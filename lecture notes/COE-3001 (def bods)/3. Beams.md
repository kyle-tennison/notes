# 3. Beams


Much of this chapter is also included in [Beams](Beams.md).

---

A **Cantilevered Beam** beam has one end fixed and one free.

A **Simply-Supported Beam** has a pinned end and a rolling end:

Simply supported beams are statically indeterminant due to the extra restraint.

From the [Beams](Beams.md) chapter, the highlights are:

- $\omega$ is the distributed force over the beam
- $V$ is the shear force.
- $M$ is the bending moment
- ^ All three are functions of $x$
- The sign convention is:

- $w = -\frac{dV}{dx}$
- $\int \limits_{V_0}^V dV=-\int\limits_{x_0}^xw\ dx$
- $V = \frac{dM}{dx}$
- $\frac{d^2M}{dx^2}=-w$
- $\int \limits _{M_0}^M dM = \int \limits_{x_0}^xV\ dx$
- When you can't integrate $V$, you may treat $\omega$ as an impulse function $\delta$. [^1]

> Notice that, as we cross the point load, the shear drops by exactly $4\ kN$, which is exactly the magnitude of that point load.
