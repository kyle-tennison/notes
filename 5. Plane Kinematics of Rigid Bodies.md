# 5. Plane Kinematics of Rigid Bodies


## Relative Velocity

Relative velocity states, pretty intuitively that,

$$\bf v_A = v_B + v_{A/B}$$

This is saying:

> The velocity of $\bf A$ is equal to the velocity of $\bf B$, plus the velocity of $\bf A$ relative to $\bf B$. 

On a rigid body, the two points remain at a fixed distance from each other. This means that the motion of $\bf A$ relative to $\bf B$ will always be *radial*. Therefore, this can be written as:

$$\bf v _A =v_B + \boldsymbol{\omega} \times r_{A/B} $$


Some things to note:
- Make sure that you get the sign of $\boldsymbol \omega$ right
