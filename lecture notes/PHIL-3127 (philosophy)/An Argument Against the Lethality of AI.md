Yudkowsky is trying to envision what a future with AGI/ASI might look like.

Traces of a game board were found in an LLM's "main network" (whatever that is).

Bard did not teach itself anything. There are linguistic patterns and likely some Bengali artifacts in the training data that allow this to happen. An LLM cannot retrain itself between prompts.

- I agree with the idea of LLMs being a form of weak AI.
- Synthetic intelligence is the emulation of biological intelligence.
