Metaphorology is the study of metaphors. 

Metaphors are kinda like art in the way that they become popular across communities. Metaphors that are used commonly can reveal how a community thinks. 

Metaphors can be implicit.

Exploration of world views and the relationship between us and that world view. 

Blumenberg wants to see how metaphors can reveal changes in culture.

Thinks that there is some sort of hidden "subterranean thought" that can only be discovered by metaphorlogical exploration. 

Well reasoned, true arguments will not always convince someone. Sometimes "truth" is analogous to belief where it's very emotional. The evidence needs to be compelling for it to be accepted.

Stoicism which focuses on logos is a good way to explore truth without necessarily depending on the emotional factor.

> 'Truth' is simply the name we give to the fact that particular representations prevail over others in human consciousness

In this representation, Truth is whatever is the most compelling. This is inline with how we often think of truth in the contemporary world.
