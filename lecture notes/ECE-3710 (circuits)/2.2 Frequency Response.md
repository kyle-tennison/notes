# 2.2 Frequency Response


## 2.2.2 Frequency Spectrum

A *Frequency Spectrum* plots the amplitude of some function over the frequency.

If a signal can be broken into constituent sine waves, you can simply sum the frequency spectra for each constituent wave to get the total frequency spectrum.

This lets you see which frequencies are dominant. 

## 2.2.3  Frequency Spectra of Real Signals

Often, a *decibel* scale is used in the frequency spectrum. 

Harmonics are integer multiples of a base frequency.

## 2.2.4 Linear Frequency Response

If you have a transfer function $H(\omega)$, you can plot $|H|$ vs $\omega$ to get a frequency spectrum. You can do the same for $\angle H(\omega)$ vs $\omega$. 

If you have a DC component, you should transform it by $H(0)$.

## 2.2.5 Bode Plot

The Bode plot is the plot of the transfer function on a logarithmic scale. 

A *decade* is the difference between a frequency and 10x that frequency. 

The decibel value is $|H(\omega)|_{dB} = 20 log_{10}(|H(\omega)|)$.  Or, the other way $|H(\omega)| = 10^{|H(\omega)|_{dB}/20}$
