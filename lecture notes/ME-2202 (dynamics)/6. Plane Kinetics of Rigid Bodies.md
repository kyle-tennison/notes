### Diagrams

Like particle dynamics, you also setup problems like so:

### Plane-Motion Equations

Angular momentum of a collection of particles is defined by:

$$\mathbf H_G = \sum \mathbf p_i\times m_i \dot {\bf p}_i$$

where $\bf p_i$ is the position vector of the particle relative to $G$ (COM). If the *mass moment of inertia* $\bar I$ is known, it may also be expressed as:

$$\mathbf H_G = \bar I \boldsymbol \omega$$

If we plug this into the [moment equation](#^8a072a), we get:

$$\sum M_G = \dot H_G = \bar I \dot \omega =\bar I \alpha$$

--- 

The moment equation for a series of particles about an *arbitrary point* $P$ is:

$$\sum \mathbf M_P = \dot{\bf H}_G + \bar {\bf p} \times m \bar{\bf a}$$
where $\bar {\bf p}$ is the vector from $P \to G$ and $\bar {\bf a}$ is the mass center acceleration. 

This can also be written as:

$$\sum M_P = \bar I \alpha + m \bar a d$$

where $d$ is the *parallel distance* between $m \bar{\bf a}$ and $\bf p$, as shown here:

![[IMG_0727.jpeg|488x384]]

The equations above **assume P is not fixed to the body**; if it were, the equations would replace $\bar {\bf a}$ with $\bf a_p$ , i.e. the acceleration of P.

$$\sum \mathbf M_P = I_P\boldsymbol{\alpha} + \bar{\bf p} \times m {\bf a_P} \quad{\text{(P Fixed on Body)}}$$

#### Interconnected Bodies

If there are multiple bodies connected to one another, then you may sum the above equations:

$$\sum\mathbf F = \sum_{}m\bar{\bf a}, \qquad\sum M_p= \sum \bar I \alpha + \sum m \bar a d$$
where the summations are taken over the set of bodies. 

### Recommended Analysis Method

1. Kinematics
		From the given kinetic information, try to solve for any relevant linear/angular velocities/accelerations that my assist in the solution.
2. Diagrams
		Draw a free body digram, an equivalent force-moment diagram, and a kinetic diagram.
3. Equations of Motion
		Apply the [force balance](#^cece6d) and the [moment equation](#^8a072a) to the problem and solve for the unknown. The book claims that there can never be more than 5 unknown values. This is irrelevant because I will shoot myself after 3 unknown values.

## Translation & Fixed Axis Rotation (6/3 & 6/4)

A rigid body undergoing translation (no rotation) will have all points on the body translate tangential to all other points. This applies to both rectilinear and curvilinear translations. Because of this, the following is true for a body *only translating*:

$$\sum M_G= \bar I \alpha = 0$$

---

For fixed axis rotation, it's obvious that $\bar {\bf a}$ and $\sum {\bf F}=0$. This leaves only:

$$\sum M_O = I_O\alpha$$

It's often easies to sum about the origin of rotation $O$ rather than the COM $G$ in this case. 

$$I_O = \bar I + m \bar r^2$$

^ from the parallel axis theorem. 

## Work-Energy Relations (6/5)

These are largely unchanged for rigid bodies.

### Work of Forces and Couples

Work of Forces:

$$U = \int\mathbf F \cdot d \mathbf r, \quad \text{or equivalently}, \quad U = \int(F\cos \alpha)\,ds$$

Work of Couples:

$$U = \int M\,d\theta$$

### Kinetic Energy

As before:

$$T = \frac 12 mv^2$$

For **fixed-axis rotation**, this is:

$$T = \frac 12 I_O \omega ^2$$

Or, for **general plane motion**, the two terms simply sum:

$$T = \frac 12 m \bar v^2 + \frac 12 \bar I \omega^2$$

If the [Instantaneous Center of Zero Velocity](5.%20Plane%20Kinematics%20of%20Rigid%20Bodies.md#Instantaneous%20Center%20of%20Zero%20Velocity) is known, this above equation can be reduced to the radial part alone:

$$T = \frac 12 I_C \omega^2$$

### Work Energy Relation

The work\* from states $1 \to 2$ is shown as $U'_{1-2}$ . The work energy relation states:

$$U'_{1\text{-}2} = \Delta T + \Delta V_g + \Delta V_e$$


> \* The $U'$ is used instead of just $U$ because it *excludes the work done by forces caused by weight and elasticity*.

where $V_g$ is gravitational potential energy and $V_e$ is elastic potential energy. 

If it is advantageous to use $U$ over $U'$, you can equivalently say:

$$U_{\text{1-2}} = \Delta T$$

If there's non-negligible friction, its influence must be encapsulated by $U$. 


### Power

For forces:
$$P = \frac{dU}{dt}={\bf F \cdot v}$$

For moments:

$$P = \frac{dU}{dt}= M \omega$$

When both exist at the same time:

$$P = {\bf F \cdot v}+ M\omega$$

Because power is the time derivative of energy, we can also look at $\dot T$, or the "power" of kinetic energy or whatever u call it idfk.

$$\begin{aligned}
\dot T &= \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac 12 m \bar{\bf v}\cdot \bar{\bf v} + \frac 12 \bar I \omega ^2\right)\\
&=\frac 12 m(\bar{\bf a} \cdot \bar{\bf v} + \bar{\bf v}\cdot \bar{\bf a}) + \bar I \omega \dot \omega\\
&=m\bar{\bf a} \cdot \bar{\bf v} + \bar I \alpha \omega =\mathbf R \cdot \bar{\bf v} + \bar M \omega
\end{aligned}$$

where $\bf R$ is the resultant force of all forces acting on the body and $\bar M$ is the resultant moment (about G) of all moments acting on the body.
