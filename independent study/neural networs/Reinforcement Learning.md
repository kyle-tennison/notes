# Reinforcement Learning

## Term Definitions

**Deep Neural Networks** are neural networks with multiple hidden layers.

**Model free** RL learns what to do without understanding how the environment works.

**Model-based** RL uses a model that can predict the next state given the current state and action.

**Policy** refers to a function $\pi (s) \to a$ that maps a *state* $s$ to an *action* $a$. The state is the input to the neural network and the action is the output of the neural network. 

**Stochastic** means randomly determined. A stochastic policy is denoted as $\pi (a | s)$ which gives "the probability of choosing action $a$ given state $s$."
