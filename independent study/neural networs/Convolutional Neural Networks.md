# Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are [Feedforward NNs](Feedforward%20NN.md) under the [Deep Learning](Deep%20Learning.md) class; they are "the de-facto standard in deep learning-based approaches to computer vision." 

New architectures, such as the transformer, are replacing CNNs in image cognition.
